                  <p>Spending a summer working above "the center of the universe" established a clear turning point in my career. I was exposed to wonderful people and realized that though I liked being a software engineer, I loved human-centered design. My time in sunny Southern California was an amazing life-changing experience.</p>

                  <p> Waiting for my acceptance into graduate school, I decided to pursue a life long dream. I spent half a year working at Walt Disney World Resort, another once in a life time experience. I interacted with people from around the world, worked for a company I greatly admire, and realized the importance of good service design. </p>
