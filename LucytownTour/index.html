      <p>This 1,800-square-foot work of art is the world’s largest <em>I Love Lucy</em> mural, painted by a father-son team of Jamestown natives, Gary Peters, Jr. and Gary Peters, Sr. It took over 500 hours and approximately 30 gallons of paint to complete and was publicly unveiled on October 15, 2012 – the 61st anniversary of <em>I Love Lucy’s</em> debut. The artwork shows Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel zooming across the George Washington Bridge while singing “California, Here We Come” in a classic <em>I Love Lucy</em> episode from 1955. The mural contains two hidden messages. Can you spot them? They include the episode number (110) and the initials of the episode title (“CHWC”). </p>

      <p>Originally the Allen Opera House, and then Shea’s Theater, this venue was once an ornate 2,000-seat vaudeville palace that a young Lucille Ball frequented to watch movies and theatrical performances. Internationally renowned artists including W. C. Fields, Gypsy Rose Lee, and John Philip Sousa performed in this venue. In 1946, Lucille Ball herself appeared on the Shea’s stage to promote the sale of war bonds. During that appearance she told the assembled crowd: “They’ll tell you that California is God’s country...but God’s country is right here in Jamestown. Think of the change of seasons, the gardens, lilacs blooming in the spring—it’s a wonderful, wonderful place.”</p>

      <p>The Little Theatre of Jamestown purchased the building in 1968. The Little Theatre is a regional community theater that was formed in 1920. In 1929, 18-year-old Lucille Ball was cast in their production of “Within the Law” – her first stage performance outside of school. In 1991, the theater was formally renamed The Lucille Ball Little Theatre of Jamestown in a ceremony with Ball’s family in attendance. The Little Theater is now New York State’s longest-running community theater organization.</p>

To welcome them, students stood in formation spelling out the words “HI LUCY DESI” and more than 15,000 people lined the streets of downtown Jamestown to greet their motorcade.</p>

In 1956, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz appeared on its stage together to announce the world premiere of their MGM feature film, <em>Forever, Darling</em>. In 1990, the theater underwent a million-dollar renovation and was renamed the Reg Lenna Center for the Arts.</p>

That was my first moving picture – something called <em>Tillie the Toiler</em>.”  </p>

In 1956, when she and Desi visited Jamestown together, they ate breakfast every morning in the coffee shop while talking with reporters and fans. </p>

The historic art deco building was meticulously restored before becoming the home of the National Comedy Center in 2018. The Comedy Center is based on Lucille Ball’s vision for her hometown to become a destination for the celebration of comedy&mdash;in all its forms. Featuring cutting-edge interactive exhibits and artifact displays, the attraction chronicles the history of the artform from vaudeville to viral memes. The National Comedy Center is the United States’ official cultural institution dedicated to preserving and presenting the vital story of comedy. The Comedy Center was recently named the Best New Museum by <em>USA Today</em> and one of <em>TIME</em>’s World’s Greatest Places. </p>

      <p>Lucille Ball spent her earliest years in the nearby town of Celoron, at the home of her maternal grandparents, Fred and Florabelle Hunt. Fred sold his home in the late 1920s and, as Lucille writes in her memoir, the family “moved away to a little apartment on Wilcox Avenue in Jamestown. I entered my junior year in a new, strange high school.” The adjustment was not easy for Lucy. In an attempt to find an outlet for her restless daughter’s energy, Lucy’s mother, Dede, gathered the family at dinner here inside the Wilcox Ave. apartment and asked: “Lucille, how would you like to go to dramatic school?” </p>

Lucy’s mother and father&mdash;Dede and Henry Ball&mdash;had moved to Montana where Henry worked as a telephone lineman. Dede returned home to have her baby and Lucy was delivered by Florabelle at home. After the birth, Dede rejoined Henry in Montana and four years later they moved to Wyandotte, Michigan, where Henry contracted typhoid fever and died in 1915. Dede returned to her parents’ home and Lucy’s brother, Fred, was born in this house five months later. </p>

      <p>Lucy went to grade school on this site, though the original schoolhouse has since been demolished. In her memoir, Lucy recalled that “the little red brick Celoron schoolhouse which we attended from kindergarten through high school was just a block from our house.” It was here that Lucy met her beloved teacher, Miss Lillian Appleby, who encouraged her to channel her artistic and expressive abilities into acting. (Lucille Ball tributed her teacher by naming a character in the <em>I Love Lucy</em> television show after her.)</p>

<p>Lucy became a member of the school’s drama club, where she directed and starred in the play “Charley’s Aunt.” A formative moment in Lucille Ball’s life occurred on this site when her stepfather, Ed Peterson, brought her to see a performance by the renowned monologist Julius Tannen in the school auditorium. As Lucy remembered, “I don’t think a stage career ever occurred to me until that night.”

      <p>Lucille Ball’s grandparents, Fred and Florabelle Hunt, owned this home where they resided with Lucy’s mother, Dede and her second husband Ed Peterson, along with Lucy, brother Fred, and cousin Cleo. Lucy’s bedroom was in the back of the house, overlooking a lilac hedge. Lilacs remained Lucille Ball’s favorite flower for the rest of her life. In her memoir, Lucy expressed that she “loved every inch of that weathered shingled house.” In its front parlor, Lucy and her brother staged amateur plays and in the backyard workshop Grandpa Hunt built “sleds and wagons and wheelbarrows, and stilts, pogo sticks, swings, teeter-totters, and treehouses.”</p>
<p>In 1927, the family was devastated when they lost this home in a tragic set of circumstances. While Grandpa Hunt was supervising children during target practice with a .22 caliber rifle, a neighbor boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed. The house was auctioned off to cover legal fees when Grandpa Hunt was charged with reckless and willful endangerment. The family relocated to the Wilcox Apartments in Jamestown.

      <p>Following the untimely death of Lucille Ball’s father, her mother, Dede, married Ed Peterson and traveled with him for his job. From the age of six until she was about eight and a half, Lucy was sent to live with Ed’s parents, Sophia and Carl Peterson. Grandma and Grandpa Peterson were strict Swedish immigrants who were harsh disciplinarians. Later Lucy would reflect that “I don’t suppose that hard work, discipline, and a perfectionist attitude toward my work did me any harm. And when life seemed unbearable, I learned to live in my imagination, and to step inside other people’s skins&mdash;indispensable abilities for an actress.” Despite the litany of chores and punishments she endured, she did develop a lifelong love for crocheting and gardening while living with the Petersons.</p>

      <p>Lakeview Cemetery dates to 1859 and is the final resting place of many of Lucille Ball’s ancestors and immediate family members. Lucy is buried in the Ball/Hunt family plot along with her parents, grandparents, and brother. As a child, Lucy would bring “great branches of blooming lilacs” to the cemetery on Memorial Day to lay on her grandmother Florabelle’s grave. “Since those days,” she explained in her memoir, “lilac has become almost an obsession with me; someone once interpreted my passion for it as signaling a return to the womb, to Celoron, to the innocent happiness of childhood.”</p>
