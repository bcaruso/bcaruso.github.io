This game looked to address <b>behavior change</b> focused around <b>engaging players with nature</b> and to <b>promote pro-environmental behavior</b>. It provides everyone the chance to <b>engage directly with nature</b>, <b>build knowledge and skills related to gardening</b>, and provides a <b>platform for local gardening communities</b> to grow. </p>

            <h3>1 | Identify Problems</h3>
            <p>The team brainstormed areas for behavior change. Through several methods, like voting and utilizing the Six Hats approach, the team identify pro-environmental behavior as our general topic. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>2 | Understand</h3>
            <p>The team explored, through secondary research, the areas of behavior change, behavior change related to pro-environmental behavior, game design, and gamification. </p>

          <div>
            <h3>3 | Ideate</h3>
            <p>The team generated ideas for using a game or gamified mobile application to
              eliminated, adopt, or change behaviors identified in research. </p>

            <div>
              <h3>4 | Refine Concept</h3>
              <p>The team focused on the Mystery Plant idea and created a user flow, concept
                sketches, and a storyboard to help explain the concept in greater detail.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>5 | Prototype</h3>
                <p>The team created a comprehensive interaction  ow to display the re ned concept. The interaction flow helped identify key points in the application to wireframe and create high-fidelity interface mock-ups. </p>

              <p>When the team received this prompt, a <b>focus</b> was needed. The team <b>identify a problem area</b> in which we could <b>research</b> in depth. This was done through a simple <b>brainstorming</b> session. The team employed many methods to identify areas for <b>behavior change</b> using the behaviors generated from the brainstorm. </p>

              <p>With little to no understanding of behavior change, pro-environmental <b>behavior models</b>, and <b>game design</b> the team began performing <b>secondary research</b> on these areas. The findings from this exploration would <b>inform decisions</b> that were made throughout the project. The team found that <b>community gardening and gardening</b>, in general, would be the best area to explore. <b>Specific gardening behaviors</b> were sorted into three groups, behaviors that could be <b>changed, adopted, or eliminated</b>. The behaviors were then mapped in relation to potential appeal to <b>young adults 18-34 in urban centers</b>.</p>

              <p>With the three behaviors of <b>making friends, learning about plants, and eating organic food</b> in mind, the team started <b>ideation</b>. The
                team performed a series of </b>timed ideation sessions</b>, between which the team <b>discussed and shared</b> their ideas.</p>
