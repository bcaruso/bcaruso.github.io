          <p class="copy">Mystery Plant is a unique mobile game that gives novices the chance to adopt gardening and become master gardeners. This game looked to address behavior change focused around engaging players with nature and to promote pro-environmental behavior. It provides everyone the chance to engage directly with nature, build knowledge and skills related to gardening, and provides a platform for local gardening communities to grow.</p>

            <h3>1 | Identify Problems</h3>
            <p>The team brainstormed areas for behavior change. Through several methods, like voting and utilizing the Six Hats approach, the team identify pro-environmental behavior as our general topic. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>2 | Understand</h3>
            <p>The team explored, through secondary research, the areas of behavior change, behavior change related to pro-environmental behavior, game design, and gamification. </p>

          <div>
            <h3>3 | Ideate</h3>

              eliminated, adopt, or change behaviors identified in research. </p>

              <h3>4 | Refine Concept</h3>
              <p>The team focused on the Mystery Plant idea and created a user flow, concept
                sketches, and a storyboard to help explain the concept in greater detail.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>5 | Prototype</h3>
                <p>The team created a comprehensive interaction flow to display the refined concept. The interaction flow helped identify key points in the application to wireframe and create high-fidelity interface mock-ups. </p>

              <p>When the team received this prompt, a focus was needed. The team identify a problem area in which we could research in depth. This was done through a simple brainstorming session. The team employed many methods, like 2x2 Matrices, the Six Hats approach, and voting, to identify and focus on areas for behavior change using the behaviors generated from the brainstorm. </p>

              <p>With little to no understanding of behavior change, pro-environmental behavior models, and game design, the team began performing secondary research on these areas. The findings from this exploration would inform decisions that were made throughout the project. The team found that community gardening and gardening, in general, would be the best area to explore. Specific gardening behaviors were sorted into three groups, behaviors that could be changed, adopted, or eliminated. The behaviors were then mapped in relation to potential appeal to young adults 18-34 in urban centers using an opportunity map.</p>

                team performed a series of timed ideation sessions, between which the team discussed and shared their ideas.</p>

                <p>With all the ideas from our ideation session gathered, the team organized them using 2x2 Matrices to narrow down to three concepts. Some of

                    <p>Converging to one concept can be a difficult task if no structure is given to the decision. Referring back to our research, the team decided to use the barriers identified for adopting pro-environmental behavior change as the judging criteria for each of the concepts.  For each barrier the team rated the concepts on whether they overcame the barrier, addressed the barrier or did not address the barrier. The concept that had the highest rating was selected.</p>

                    <p>The look and feel of the application went through several iterations. The visual design needed to accompany and support the growing of plants in real life and in no way attempting to monopolize the attention of the player. Designing these interfaces was a personal endeavor and, as in many portions of the project, was a learning opportunity.</p>

Allowing friends to play together, not only helps both players explore garden themes faster, but also starts a conversation outside the game. Players can seek help with gardening questions or just get in contact with fellow local gardeners in the Community section of the game. </p>
