          <p>Louis took root from a simple Arduino project. This initial implementation prototype sparked the desire to give form to the simple circuitry and to craft a functioning keyboard that can interface with a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. From its simple beginnings to its completed state, Louis is a true exploration of iterative prototyping.</p>

          <p>The goal was to create a comfortable keyboard that fit and supported the natural curvature of the hand. The entire device was also designed to fit inside a backpack or medium to large size bag. After some initial sketches, these drawings were translated into clay.</p>

          <h2>evaluation</h2>
          <p>Using the clay model, three individuals were asked to judge the comfort, support, and key placement of the model. All participants thought the form was comfortable and that most of the keys were in a good location and orientation. However, they all suggested moving the spacebar to the front of the form. This early evaluation helped avoid uncovering this issue after creating the higher fidelity version. The clay model allowed for quick iterations and modifications.</p>

          <p>With the clay model finalized, the form was translated into Rhino 3D to create a digital model. The shape of the keys, the placement of the electronic components, and the mounting for the various keyboard switches were all incorporated into this digital model. Both the schematic and PCB design were completed using Eagle CAD. The digital model was used to create the outline of the PCB.</p>

          <p>The main feature lacking in the current design is feedback on past text input. This is normally done by a braille readout. Including this component would increase the price of the device because of the small elements used in the component. Other alternatives should be considered if future iterations are explored to maintain Louisâ€™s low cost goal. The software should also be improved to support special characters that require multiple braille characters to represent and include support for braille characters that represent common words (i.e. for, but, in). Another future goal is to make Louis open source.</p>
