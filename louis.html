          <p>Louis took root from a simple <b>Arduino</b> project. This initial <b>implementation prototype</b> sparked the desire to <b>give form to the simple circuitry</b> and to craft a <b>functioning keyboard</b> that can interface with a <b>laptop, tablet, or smartphone</b>. From its simple beginnings to its completed state, Louis is a true exploration of <b>iterative prototyping</b>.</p>

          <p>The goal was to create a <b>comfortable</b> keyboard that fit and supported the <b>natural curvature of the hand</b>. The entire device was also designed to <b>fit inside a backpack</b> or medium to large size bag. After some initial <b>sketches</b>, these drawings were translated into <b>clay</b>.</p>

        <div id = "evaluation">
          <h2>evaluation</h2>
          <p>Using the clay model, <b>three individuals</b> were asked to judge the <b>comfort, support, and key placement</b> of the model. <b>All participants</b> thought the form was <b>comfortable</b> and that most of the keys were in a <b>good location and orientation</b>. However, they all suggested <b>moving the spacebar</b> to the front of the form. This <b>early evaluation</b> helped avoid uncovering this issue after creating the higher fidelity version. The <b>clay</b> model allowed for <b>quick iterations</b> and modifications.</p>

          <p>With the <b>clay model</b> finalized, the form was translated into <b>Rhino 3D</b> to create a <b>digital model</b>. The shape of the <b>keys</b>, the placement of the <b>electronic components</b>, and the <b>mounting</b> for the various keyboard switches were all incorporated into this digital model. Both the <b>schematic and PCB design</b> were completed using <b>Eagle CAD</b>. The digital model was used to create the outline of the PCB.</p>

          <p>The main feature <b>lacking</b> in the current design is <b>feedback</b> on past text input. This is normally done by a <b>braille readout</b>. Including this component would <b>increase the price</b> of the device because of the <b>small elements</b> used in the component. <b>Other alternatives</b> should be considered if future iterations are explored to maintain Louisâ€™s <b>low cost goal</b>. The <b>software</b> should also be improved to <b>support special characters</b> that require multiple braille characters to represent and include support for <b>braille characters</b> that represent <b>common words</b> (i.e. for, a, but, in).</p>
