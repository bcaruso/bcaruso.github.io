          <h1>Dan Aykroyd’s Motorcycle</h1>

          <p class="ad"> A 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle is elevated on a black platform.The panels behind the motorcycle read:</p>

          <h2>Text written by Dan Aykroyd</h2>

          <p>This 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle was ridden by me as my principal method of commuting from Ontario, Canada to Manhattan and back during the four years I worked on <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, from 1975-1979.</p>
          <p>The bike was purchased originally by the Ontario Provincial Police where it was used as a component of their Golden Helmets twelve member precision drill riding team. While performing a pyramid display in Europe (where all the riders climb on the back of two teammates riding two motorcycles with one member standing atop the shoulders of the highest man) there was an accident, the pyramid collapsed, and a motor officer was killed.</p>
          <p>Twelve man pyramid motorcycle riding is dangerous.</p>
          <p>My FLH-P, 1200cc, Electra-Glide with solo seat was NOT the bike involved in the fatality, but it was part of the display formation.</p>
          <p>As for the $2,100 I paid to the wholesale broker who bought the bikes at auction and shipped them back from Germany (I picked the lead bike with the turn signals), my money proved to be well spent. The Police Special certified speedometer is worth more to collectors now than the entire motorcycle itself.  (Although the bike’s enshrinement here may add some value.)</p>
          <p>The clock reflects the miles from my commutes in all seasons.</p>
          <p>In September of 1975, on the first ride to my new job at SNL, halfway down southbound I-81 a station wagon with a large family of children slowed down beside me.</p>
          <p>Everyone began waving and smiling at me. Now this is prior to my appearance on TV in the United States, so I wasn’t known. I thought isn’t this a nice welcome to the United States! Then a few other cars and their passengers pulled up beside me and did the same thing. People smiling, waving, and a few pointing and laughing. What are they looking at? So glancing around to myself, the engine, and my cargo, I looked behind my seat to see that the entire rear end of the motorcycle was on FIRE.</p>
          <p>One of my green army surplus canvas saddlebags had been ignited by the exhaust pipe and the contents of the bag (scripts etc.) were now fully aflame. I was sure that an explosion would be next.</p>
          <p>After pulling over quickly to rip the bag away and beat the flame out, a pair of compassionate outlaw bikers pulled over in their van and offered me assistance plus a cold Genesee.</p>
          <p>Getting my kit straight, the trip resumed and at around eleven pm I entered the far right inbound lane of the George Washington Bridge. Halfway across the span all my electrics CUT OUT and the machine went dead. There is no break down lane on the bridge. The problem had happened before. In the 1970s, Harley partnered with the American Machine Foundry Corporation (a manufacturer of bowling alleys) to supply components for motorcycles.</p>
          <p>Harley-AMF bikes were notorious for electrical glitches. But here was not the optimum location for intricate wiring adjustments with all sizes of vehicles swerving and blaring horns in order to avoid hitting my darkened machine and me. In this setting I was compelled to take out my tools, remove the front headlight cowling and secure the wiring.</p>
          <p>Having to do these repairs on the most hazardous traffic spot on earth was a nightmare.</p>
          <p>After about eight tension-filled minutes I got the ‘Electra-Glide’ restarted and gunned it off the bridge into Harlem. People laughed and pointed at me there too as my ride took me in the wrong directions down many one way streets in my desperate search for the lights of Broadway.</p>
          <p>This first ride concluded with my arrival in Greenwich Village near 376 Bleecker Street where John Belushi and his girlfriend Judy lived. John had instructed me to call from a payphone. Seeing a bar with multiple Harleys lined up outside I stopped there and backed in.</p>
          <p>Inside the bar there were other riders. They were similarly attired as myself – black jeans, black denim jackets, black western shirts, leather jackets, Herman boots, and multi-colored handkerchiefs hanging from the right and left pockets of the men’s jeans – yellow, green, light blue or red like mine. You know, for oil checks.</p>
          <p>My arrival was virtually unnoticed. I ordered a beer, and reaching John on the telephone, he quickly informed me that I was in the local hardcore gay biker nightclub. I hung up, finished my beer, and exchanged some Harley talk with a couple of the guys on the sidewalk outside before heading to John’s. Riders are riders everywhere.</p>
          <p>For the first two years of the show I would park the machine in the Associated Press courier slots across from Rock Center. These are long gone. When I wasn’t using it in the city, it sat UNLOCKED outside my high-rise apartment at 80 North Moore Street. Once Tom Davis and I left for a month long tour of South America. Upon returning the bike was still there untouched except for the residue of repeated sprayings on my front rim from dogs.</p>
          <p>In its last New York years this Harley lived on the fourth floor of my loft at 35 Bond Street. It just fit by inches into the freight elevator and sat during the winters in the living room through many great parties.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased that the ride from my SNL years has found such a prestigious and caring home.</p>
          <p>Gift of Dan Aykroyd</p>

          <p>Andy Kaufman was a renegade who diverged from mainstream comedy. Beyond his memorable performances on Taxi and Saturday Night Live, Kaufman fully embodied oddball characters like Foreign Man, an uncomfortable, nervous impressionist who could suddenly transform into a spot-on Elvis Presley. Kaufman also seized headlines with outrageous public performances. Among other students, Kaufman challenged women to wrestling matches, and stepped into the ring with professional wrestler Jerry “ The King” Lawler.</p>

          <p>A. Letter to Elvis Presley, 1969: Andy Kaufman idolized Elvis Presley and wrote to him while attending Graham Junior College in Boston. In 1929, he traveled (uninvited) to Las Vegas to introduce himself to Elvis.</p>

          <h1>George Carlin’s Stuff</h1>

          <p>“I review a file and I get excited: ‘This shit’s going to be GOOD! Can’t wait till they hear THIS!’”</p>

          <p>—George Carlin</p>

          <p>How did a comic genius like George Carlin craft his jokes? What insights and observations inspired his most famous routines? Fortunately for comedy fans, the answers lie within the staggering amount of personal material that the comedian assembled over the course of his 50-year career.</p>

          <p>Carlin meticulously recorded his experiences and reflected on his art and life. He logged notes in diary-like appointment books, diligently filed away ticket stubs and newspaper reviews, and saved annotated drafts of almost every comedy set he performed. For decades, he jotted down pithy observations on hotel stationery and scraps of paper, all of which were thoughtfully catalogued in alphabetized Ziploc bags. Today, this collection beautifully illustrates the constant and careful observation, accumulation, and organization of ideas that formed the bedrock of Carlin’s comedic process.</p>

          <p>Carlin left behind more than 50 boxes of paper material, photographs, and other memorabilia, as well as over 1,000 hours of rare audiovisual footage. Packed into steamer trunks, this extraordinary material came to light shortly after Carlin’s passing in 2008, when five storage units filled with the comedian’s “stuff” were inherited by his daughter, Kelly.</p>

          <p>The George Carlin Collection, acquired by the National Comedy Center in 2016, offers a unique and extraordinarily intimate window into the mind of one of comedy’s most prolific and influential figures. This exclusive glimpse into the collection has been designed to represent, as closely as possible, Carlin’s own extensive efforts to document his life and work.</p>

          <h1>Late Night</h1>

          <p>Late-night talk shows have produced some of comedy’s biggest names, from Carson and Leno to Letterman and Conan. Hundreds of comedians got their big break from an after-hours appearance, and many late-night interviews—whether serious, funny, or just plain bizarre—became front-page news.</p>

          <p>As end-of-day entertainment, late night has provided a reliable mix of crowd-pleasing humor and must-see commentary. With jokes about topics like Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandal, as well as interviews with public figures from JFK to Donald Trump, late night has captured the very history of modern America.</p>

          <h2>Late Night Kicks Off</h2>

          <p>The idea of airing a television show after 11 p.m. was initially rejected as lunacy. Network executives simply did not think anyone would watch TV that late. Broadway Open House was the first program to test the time slot, premiering live on May 29, 1950, from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. To find a studio audience at such an odd hour, NBC wrangled people from the nearby Greyhound bus station.</p>

          <p>Airing five nights a week, Broadway Open House created a demanding workload, and NBC soon hired two comedians, Jerry Lester and Morey Amsterdam, to host on alternate nights. Lester opened each episode by telling jokes, interacting with the studio audience, and bantering with bandleader Milton Delugg. Although the program favored comedy sketches and musical guests over interviews, it established late night’s general template.</p>

          <h2>Tonight Finds Its Focus</h2>

          <p>In June 1953, NBC revamped its programming with a new late-night show hosted by former radio comedian Steve Allen. The program debuted as The Knickerbocker Beer Show and was renamed Tonight! in 1954. Only East Coast audiences saw these early episodes, as the technology for broadcasting coast-to-coast did not yet exist.</p>

          <p>During his tenure, Steve Allen made spontaneity a late-night hallmark, confidently wandering into the audience and posing the kind of “Where you folks from?” questions now associated with comedy clubs. In most cases, these impromptu moments earned Allen huge laughs.</p>

          <p>In 1957, NBC unveiled Tonight Starring Jack Paar. Also a former radio comedian, Paar introduced several classic late-night features: a long opening monologue, a sidekick co-host, and a focus on interviews. He was constantly in the news for picking fights with the press, feuding with guests, and criticizing NBC. During an opening monologue in 1960 he quit the program and walked off the show, leaving sidekick Hugh Downs scrambling to cover the remaining airtime. Although Paar soon returned, he left Tonight permanently in 1962, worn down by the demands of hosting a 105-minute program every weeknight.</p>

          <h2>Reign of the King</h2>

          <p>Johnny Carson was still under contract to ABC when he was hired to replace Jack Paar. While waiting for Carson, NBC brought on temporary hosts such as Jerry Lewis, Arlene Francis, Groucho Marx, and a young Merv Griffin. The network was so impressed by Griffin’s natural ease with guests that it hired him as a backup host “in case Johnny didn’t work out.”</p>

          <p>With Carson’s ABC contract finally completed, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson—and its daytime counterpart, The Merv Griffin Show—premiered on October 1, 1962, broadcasting from NBC’s Studio 6B. It took Carson a full year to find his footing and win over hostile critics, but he eventually developed into a smooth, reliable wit, known for his impish charm and ability to think on his feet.</p>

          <p>The Tonight Show hit full stride in the 1970s, establishing its iconic imagery—plaid suits, tricolor backdrop curtain, phantom golf swings—and familiar grace notes: cracks about jokes falling flat, good-natured ribbing about Ed McMahon’s drinking, a constant haze of cigarette smoke. Providing a national platform for countless politicians, celebrities, and comics, Carson was truly “the King of Late Night.”</p>

          <h2>The Network Battles Begin</h2>

          <p>NBC dominated late night for over a decade, with the other networks simply airing old movies or test patterns in the time slot. In 1964, ABC unveiled Tonight’s first actual competitor: The Les Crane Show, starring the provocative former radio host. Crane was soon fired, but when ABC relaunched the program as Nightlife in 1965, he returned with comedian Nipsey Russell—network television’s first Black co-host—at his side.</p>

          <p>A new syndicated version of The Merv Griffin Show, produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting, aired in May 1965 and was scheduled against Carson in several markets. Griffin gave comedians license to do whatever they liked short of cursing, and it’s no coincidence that George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Lily Tomlin all emerged as bold new voices shortly after their guest appearances on the show.</p>

          <p>In 1967, ABC hired the low-key member of Frank Sinatra’s Rat Pack to host The Joey Bishop Show. When Bishop went to Vietnam to entertain the troops, guest hosts included comedians Don Rickles and Totie Fields. The show’s announcer was a young Regis Philbin.</p>

          <p>August 1969 marked the start of the “late-night wars,” with all three networks airing competing talk shows: Carson on NBC, Bishop on ABC, and yet another version of The Merv Griffin Show on CBS. In order to secure Griffin, CBS had—amazingly—met his demand to receive double Carson’s salary.</p>

          <h2>Early Iconoclasts</h2>

          <p>Airing from 1969 to 1973, The Dick Cavett Show coincided with some of the nation’s most tumultuous moments. While Carson was deliberately apolitical, Cavett jumped into the fray, booking antiwar activists, hippie spokespeople, and controversial figures from both the right and left. As a result, the program remains one of the most important social documents in television history. In late 1973, ABC relegated the show to a once-a-month broadcast that ended in 1975. Many concluded that the Nixon administration was behind the demotion.</p>

          <p>In January 1973, ABC tried out George Carlin as a potential replacement for Cavett. Only the pilot of The George Carlin Show ever aired: Carlin wore his trademark tie-dyed T-shirt and interviewed Shelley Winters, among other guests. The episode tested poorly and ABC dropped the project.</p>

          <h2>Guest Hosts Go Big</h2>

          <p>During the 1970s, The Tonight Show was the most profitable program on television, and Carson wielded incredible power. He demanded higher pay and took longer vacations, opening the door to a series of guest hosts including David Brenner, Betty White, Bob Newhart, David Steinberg, and McLean Stevenson. By the 1980s, the most frequent guest hosts were Garry Shandling, Joan Rivers, and Jay Leno.</p>

          <p>David Letterman was another standby host on The Tonight Show, filling in for Carson nearly 50 times between 1978 and 1981. Impressed with his natural abilities, NBC hired Letterman for a morning talk show beginning in 1980. The early time slot proved inappropriate for his sarcastic wit and The David Letterman Show was soon canceled, but the comedian earned two Emmys for it and developed signature segments such as “Stupid Pet Tricks.”</p>

          <p>Late Night with David Letterman premiered in February 1982 and became one of the most influential late-night programs of all time, with a rebellious underground vibe and an art-school sensibility. Stand-up comedians Jonathan Katz, Norm Macdonald, Adam Sandler, and Jon Stewart all got major breaks on the program, which also introduced cult favorites Harvey Pekar, Pee-wee Herman, and Larry “Bud” Melman to a national audience.</p>

          <h2>The Late Show: Rivers to Hall</h2>

          <p>The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers debuted on the brand-new Fox television network in October 1986, making Rivers the first woman to helm a network late-night talk show. Although Rivers interviewed Lucille Ball and introduced Chris Rock, the show is perhaps best remembered for the rift it caused between Rivers and Carson. With Fox unavailable in many markets, the program was not widely seen and was canceled in 1987.</p>

          <p>Hired to host the remaining Late Show episodes, Arsenio Hall stunned executives with a massive ratings spike and was offered his own program in 1989. The Arsenio Hall Show was a cultural phenomenon, best remembered for its time capsule trademarks—Hall’s high-top fade, the “Dog Pound” section of the studio audience, and the whooping sound the crowd made as Hall circled his fist in the air. In perhaps the show’s most famous moment, Bill Clinton played the saxophone while campaigning for the presidency.</p>

          <h2>Leno vs. Letterman</h2>

          <p>After 30 years on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson retired in May 1992, causing seismic shifts in the late-night landscape and kicking off an intense rivalry between Jay Leno and David Letterman. Many assumed that Letterman, as Carson’s protégé, would ascend to the Tonight Show throne. Instead, the crown was passed to Leno, Carson’s frequent guest host. Both the public and the press went wild for behind-the-scenes gossip about the feud.</p>

          <p>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno debuted in May 1992. Leno’s lengthy opening monologue, notable for the sheer volume of jokes, was modeled on Bob Hope’s television specials. Recurring segments included “Headlines,” which highlighted moronic newspaper stories from around the country, and “Jaywalking,” in which Leno asked people on the street simple questions and received painfully wrong answers—to great comedic effect.</p>

          <p>In 1993, Letterman shifted networks and time slots to become Leno’s direct competition—not to mention the highest-paid host in late-night history. Airing at 11:30 p.m. on CBS, The Late Show with David Letterman made stars out of local business owners like Rupert Jee of the Hello Deli and featured countless iconic moments in its 22-year run: Drew Barrymore dancing on the desk, Letterman taking over a Taco Bell, a difficult interview with Joaquin Phoenix, and a somber address after 9/11.</p>

          <p>Leno trailed Letterman in the ratings until July 1995, when actor Hugh Grant, just days after being arrested with a prostitute, addressed the scandal on The Tonight Show. Leno’s memorable first question: “What the hell were you thinking?” From that episode until his retirement in 2014, Jay Leno remained at the top of late-night ratings.</p>

          <h2>The Midnight Hour: Conan and Kimmel</h2>

          <p>Late Night with Conan O’Brien first aired in September 1993, filling Letterman’s vacant 12:30 a.m. slot at NBC. It was, according to head writer Robert Smigel, “a sketch comedy program disguised as a talk show.” Much of the humor was simply too weird and awkward for veteran critics, who called for the program’s cancellation. The issue wasn’t lack of comic talent—O’Brien had written for both Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons—but lack of on-camera experience.</p>

          <p>Despite the rocky start, O’Brien’s offbeat style spoke to the under-30 set, and recurring characters such as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and Andy Richter’s Little Sister—played by Amy Poehler—gave the show a unique stamp. In the end, Late Night with Conan O’Brien lasted for 16 years, winning dedicated fans and the respect of the comedy community itself.</p>

          <p>After an eight-month stint hosting The Tonight Show, O’Brien moved to TBS and launched Conan in 2010. The new program was distinguished by extended specials that wittily explored serious issues in places like Armenia, Cuba, and Mexico.</p>

          <p>In 2003, ABC tapped former radio host and Comedy Central regular Jimmy Kimmel for the midnight slot. For years, Jimmy Kimmel Live! struggled to find its footing, but eventually hit its stride with segments such as “This Week in Unnecessary Censorship” and “Mean Tweets,” as well as a running gag about Kimmel’s mock feud with actor Matt Damon. In 2012, Kimmel moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot to compete directly—and successfully—against Leno and Letterman. The show’s newsworthy moments included an appearance by beleaguered Toronto mayor Rob Ford; comedian Andy Dick’s ejection from the program; and Kimmel’s heartfelt pleas for socialized health care.</p>

          <h2>Expanding the Lineup</h2>

          <p>Chelsea Lately premiered in 2007 on the E! channel and became cable TV’s first runaway success in the late-night slot. Along with conducting guest interviews, host Chelsea Handler led a rotating panel of comedians in ridiculing celebrities—a perfect match for E!’s gossipy style. Handler also gave many Los Angeles–based comedians their television debuts, making a concerted effort to showcase little-known female comics such as Natasha Leggero and Whitney Cummings.</p>

          <p>In 2009, two shows brought a small amount of diversity to the late-night lineup. The Wanda Sykes Show lasted only four months on Fox, but was the first late-night talk show hosted by an openly gay woman. On TBS, Mexican American comedian George Lopez became the first Latino to host his own program on English-language television. Lopez Tonight ran for nearly two years.</p>

          <h2>The Late Late Shift</h2>

          <p>The Late Late Show on CBS premiered in January 1995. It aired immediately after Letterman and was produced by his company, Worldwide Pants. Over the next decade, the program went through multiple formats and hosts, from legendary broadcaster Tom Snyder to frat-boy sportscaster Craig Kilborn.</p>

          <p>The program finally found its stride in 2005 with comedian Craig Ferguson at the helm. Ferguson affected a devil-may-care style, often ripping up his interview notes to signal that freewheeling entertainment took priority over polished sound bites. In his opening monologues, he often discussed personal experiences rather than delivering topical jokes—a style that harkened back to Jack Paar.</p>

          <p>James Corden replaced Ferguson in 2015, bringing a brisk pace and an emphasis on music to The Late Late Show. “Carpool Karaoke” became its most famous feature, with Corden driving around famous pop stars like Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Rod Stewart while they sang along to their greatest hits. The short segments lent themselves perfectly to YouTube, and many fans discovered Corden online rather than on television.</p>

          <h2>Politics Takes Center Stage</h2>

          <p>Thanks to the major influence of Jon Stewart and The Daily Show, late night shifted its focus from straightforward interviews to comedic political commentary. Although the satirical programs helmed by former Daily Show correspondents Samantha Bee and John Oliver couldn’t be defined as talk shows, they were among the most important programs in the modern late-night landscape.</p>

          <p>Late Night with Seth Meyers, which debuted in 2014, brought this new political angle to the late-night talk show. Rather than opening with a standing monologue, Meyers ultimately chose to sit behind a desk, cracking wise about current events as news graphics appeared on-screen. It became a trademark element, combining Meyers’s experience anchoring SNL’s “Weekend Update” with his penchant for fearless political commentary. The segment “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell” also flouted late-night conventions, with two of the show’s female writers—one Black and one gay—flanking Meyers as they spouted punch lines that would be in poor taste if delivered by a straight white man.</p>

          <p>In 2015, Stephen Colbert transitioned from parody to politics by leaving The Colbert Report on Comedy Central to host The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS. The show struggled for a full year as viewers adjusted to Colbert’s new persona as an actual talk-show host, and then the program found its groove during the 2016 presidential campaign. An opening monologue packed with political jokes, relentless mockery of the White House, and interviews with reporters, policy wonks, and politicians distinguished the program.</p>

          <p>One exception to the political trend was Jimmy Fallon, known for delivering lighthearted fare to viewers of all political persuasions. Fallon became host of Late Night in 2009, and despite critics and naysayers, his energy and charm brought in a new, younger audience. Five years later, Fallon inherited The Tonight Show, altering the format to include competitions like “Password” and “Lip Sync Battle.” The program broadcast from Studio 6B in 30 Rockefeller Center, the same studio where Johnny Carson made his Tonight Show debut back in 1962.</p>

          <p>Today, the era of late-night talk shows on network television may be coming to a close, as people watch less traditional television or abandon their TV sets entirely. Netflix programming like Handler’s Chelsea and Letterman’s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction brought late night into the streaming age and made time of day irrelevant for viewers. The future of the format—like a great talk-show guest—is impossible to predict. For now, late night remains a staple of the American experience, providing comedy and controversy well past our bedtimes.</p>

          <h1>Great One-Liners</h1>
          <p>“Brevity is the soul of wit,” wrote Shakespeare in <u>Hamlet</u>. Case in point: the short-but-sweet jokes known as one-liners. Most are no longer than a sentence, but they can still pack a powerful comedic punch. </p>
          <p>Consisting of just two elements—a setup and a punchline—one-liners are deceptively simple. In fact, comedians carefully craft each word of these zingers to engage, tease, surprise, and delight their audience—and above all, leave them laughing.</p>

          <h1>History of an Art Form</h1>
          <p>The story of comedy is one of evolution. Each era has influenced the next, from Greek satire to Shakespeare, vaudeville acts to radio sitcoms, television variety shows to viral videos. Informed by its predecessors, modern comedy reflects the unique sensibilities of our time. It is an ongoing collaboration between past and present, driven by the enduring desire to make people laugh.</p>
          <h2>Ancient Greek Comedy</h2>
          <p>The philosopher Aristotle speculated that comedy originated with the komos, a bawdy celebration involving song, dance, and phallic processions. The very word comedy comes from the Greek komoidia, or “revel song.” Aristotle defined comedy as “the imitation of baser men,” reflecting their errors and vices as a means of illuminating our own.</p>
          <p>Most ancient Greek comedy has been lost to the ages, but 11 plays by Aristophanes survive as the primary examples of the genre. Witty and often outrageous, these works lampoon everyone from politicians to philosophers, suggesting that ancient Greece was the cradle of satire.</p>
          <h2>Shakespearean Comedy</h2>
          <p>Many of Shakespeare’s comedies—The Tempest, Measure for Measure, The Merchant of Venice—are really tragedies with happy endings. They’re closer in tone to what today’s audiences would call “dramedy.”</p>
          <p>Yet the Bard’s comic devices, employed in plays such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, have had a lasting influence on the genre. The case of mistaken identity is just one Shakespearean template that has continued to earn laughs in sitcoms and films, from The Great Dictator to The Big Lebowski.</p>
          <p>Modern parodies of Shakespeare include Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and the Improvised Shakespeare Company’s stage shows, featuring ad-libbed Elizabethan dialogue.</p>
          <h2>Commedia dell’Arte</h2>
          <p>Originating in Italy, commedia dell’arte was an early form of improvised sketch comedy that flourished from the 16th to 18th centuries. Its expressive characters and stock situations influenced some of Europe’s best-known playwrights, including Molière and Shakespeare, and the style eventually spread across the continent. </p>
          <p>Commedia dell’arte was the Curb Your Enthusiasm of its day. Scenes featured scripted entrances and exits but were otherwise loosely improvised. Because character traits were well established, audiences could anticipate how an actor might respond at any given moment. </p>
          <p>Recurring characters included the masculine soldier whose bravado was obviously false, the well-intentioned klutz who blundered in every situation, and the sad clown who amused others but lived in heartbreak. The word zany is derived from the commedia dell’arte character Zanni, an emotional and foolish practical joker.</p>
          <h2>British Pantomime</h2>
          <p>An offshoot of commedia dell’arte, British pantomime or “panto” still thrives today. This broad form of theater, often based on well-known children’s stories, is traditionally performed during the Christmas season.</p>
          <p>The most famous pantomime character is “the dame”—typically a man playing a matronly, outrageous woman. Drag comedy, popularized by Milton Berle in the 1940s and later by Monty Python, Dame Edna, and the Kids in the Hall, can be traced back to the dame tradition in British pantomime. </p>
          <p>Today, panto productions often involve audience participation, with actors moving through the crowd and sometimes embarrassing patrons by sitting on their laps or commenting on their appearance. </p>
          <h2>Vaudeville</h2>
          <p>A variety show featuring singers, dancers, and comedians, vaudeville boomed at the end of the Civil War. Former slaves had limited career options in the 1860s, and many became traveling performers. With an influx of immigrants into the United States at the end of the 19th century, vaudeville comedy reflected the influence of these new arrivals—as well as anxieties about them.</p>
          <p>By the early 1900s, vaudeville had become big business, with monopolies dominating a handful of theatrical circuits. The Marx Brothers, Fanny Brice, and the comedy duo of George Burns and Gracie Allen all emerged during this period. At the same time, an African American vaudeville circuit, called the Theater Owners Booking Association, provided entertainment for segregated Black audiences. Despite intense racism, breakout stars like Bert Williams succeeded in crossing over from vaudeville to Broadway, performing in revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.</p>
          <p>As Broadway continued to lure away top talent, vaudeville began its steady decline. By the early ’30s, vaudeville was essentially over, laid to rest by the stock market crash, the ascendance of radio, and the emergence of talking motion pictures.</p>
          <h2>Burlesque</h2>
          <p>Burlesque comedy is frequently confused with vaudeville, which flourished during the same era. Burlesque acts were broader and far more salacious, full of sexual innuendo and double entendres. They were also more predictable, with comedians often performing stock routines in the same way a modern band might cover pop songs. </p>
          <p>Mainstream performers who got their start in burlesque include Abbott and Costello, Phil Silvers, and Red Buttons. Bert Lahr, best known as the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz, was also a popular burlesque comic. </p>
          <p>Burlesque reached its peak during the 1920s and 1930s, but struggled to survive frequent police raids, with many comedians, dancers, and theater owners arrested on obscenity charges. In later decades, burlesque comedy stuck mainly to nostalgia circuits in locales like Miami Beach. The famed Minsky’s Burlesque sought refuge from the censors by settling in Las Vegas.</p>
          <h2>Literary Humor</h2>
          <p>Established in the 1800s, American literary humor found its most influential figure in Samuel Clemens, writing under the pen name Mark Twain. In How to Tell a Story and Other Essays, Twain wrote, “The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the matter.” Twain’s manner was irreverent, satirical, realistic—and immensely popular.</p>
          <p>Originally a vaudeville comedian and silent film star, Will Rogers reached his largest audience through the written word. His syndicated column made him America’s most widely read political satirist during the 1920s and early ’30s. As such, he was both praised and scorned. A 1932 letter to a newspaper editor sounds oddly contemporary: “I read Will Rogers, but why does he have to dabble in politics? Let him stay on the funny stuff where he belongs.”</p>
          <p>The Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s was named after the New York hotel where a group of famed writers gathered for lunch. Calling themselves “the Vicious Circle,” this collective of sharp-tongued columnists, humorists, and playwrights included Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman, and Herman J. Mankiewicz. They remain some of the most influential humor writers of all time. </p>
          <p>Many Algonquin members wrote for the New Yorker, which has showcased humor since its debut in 1925. Frequent contributors S.J. Perelman and James Thurber became the toast of Manhattan, while later writers such as Sarah Vowell, David Rakoff, and David Sedaris earned big laughs as talk show guests. Likewise, stand-up legends Steve Martin and Woody Allen also successfully dabbled as New Yorker humorists.</p>
          <h2>Silent Films</h2>
          <p>Slapstick entered the national consciousness during the silent film era, particularly through the work of film producers Hal Roach and Mack Sennett. These two friendly rivals popularized many beloved comic devices—wild chase sequences, death-defying stunts, pie fights, and pratfalls—often making things up as they went along. </p>
          <p>From their respective studios, Roach and Sennett practically built early Hollywood, turning comedy films into the country’s favorite—and most profitable—form of entertainment. Their combined output introduced the world to Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Laurel and Hardy, the Little Rascals, the Keystone Kops, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd. </p>
          <p>Silent film comedies flourished in the United States from roughly 1915 to the late 1920s, creating America’s first real comedy boom. As slapstick became increasingly popular, other film companies got in on the act. With little knowledge or experience in comedy, these fly-by-night studios overwhelmed the market with their derivative humor and second-rate Charlie Chaplin imitators. The result: America’s first comedy bust. </p>
          <p>At the end of the 1920s, talking motion pictures took over, and East Coast playwrights moved west to write witty dialogue. For silent film comedians, the verbal humor of Mae West and the Marx Brothers spelled the end of an era.</p>
          <h2>Radio</h2>
          <p>Radio became the critical medium for comedy during the 1930s and 1940s, serving as the bridge between the end of vaudeville and the emergence of television. Vaudevillians who brought their comic style to radio included Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Bob Hope, and George Burns and Gracie Allen.</p>
          <p>Radio comedy was much tamer than nightclub comedy, thanks to the influence of corporate sponsors. Campbell’s Soup and Lucky Strike cigarettes often had more control over the tone of a program than the comedians themselves, and offending scripts were frequently cut to ribbons.Despite this censorship, notable writers such as Larry Gelbart and Nat Hiken got their start in radio.</p>
          <p>Radio essentially invented the sitcom, with programs like Amos ’n’ Andy, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve, and My Favorite Husband dominating the airwaves. The radio sitcom Duffy’s Tavern, which featured a cast of colorful characters sitting around a bar, was created by comedy writer Abe Burrows. His son, James Burrows, later co-created the television sitcom Cheers.</p>
          <p>As television took over in the 1950s, radio listenership dwindled and advertisers shifted their attention to TV. Without the constant scrutiny of sponsors, offbeat radio programs like The Bob & Ray Show and The Stan Freberg Show were able to get on the air. These shows brought satire and absurdity to the final days of network radio comedy—a tone that later influenced National Lampoon, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night with David Letterman. </p>
          <p>The 1970s saw radio comedy revamped with the National Lampoon Radio Hour, a syndicated program featuring future stars Bill Murray, Christopher Guest, Gilda Radner, and Harold Ramis, among others. The show took advantage of loosening social mores and had a snarky, satirical bent. </p>
          <p>On his nationally syndicated morning show, Howard Stern and his cast of characters pushed the limits of acceptability—a provocative stance that continued with Stern’s 2006 move to satellite radio. At the same time, he set the bar for comedy interviews, holding insightful conversations with stars such as Joan Rivers, Don Rickles, and Jerry Seinfeld.</p>
          <h2>Motion Pictures</h2>
          <p>Silent films gave way to talking motion pictures in the late 1920s, and these “talkies” soon made superstars of the Marx Brothers, Mae West, and W.C. Fields. During the financial downturns of the 1940s, it was comedy icons such as Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton who kept their respective film studios afloat.</p>
          <p>In the mid-20th century, talented screenwriters Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder began directing their own films, pioneering the writer-director role and wresting creative control from the studios. Sturges became the undisputed master of screwball comedy with films like The Lady Eve, while Wilder provided Hollywood with whip-smart comedies such as Some Like It Hot and The Apartment. Peter Sellers invaded American cinema in the 1960s, starring in everything from the Pink Panther detective spoofs to Stanley Kubrick’s satirical Dr. Strangelove. The latter marked a shift in film comedy, from feel-good fare to grim indictments of American culture from writers like Terry Southern, George Axelrod, and Buck Henry.</p>
          <p>Among the most admired practitioners of film comedy in the 1970s were Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, early auteurs whose names alone were enough to open a film. Brooks teamed up with Richard Pryor to write Blazing Saddles shortly before Pryor became a major comedy star.</p>
          <p>Films in the 1980s relied heavily on the talents of cast members from Saturday Night Live and SCTV. Sketch comedy veterans John Candy, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Steve Martin starred in mainstream hits directed by John Landis, John Hughes, Harold Ramis, and Ivan Reitman.</p>
          <p>Together with Jim Abrahams, brothers David and Jerry Zucker created a new genre of deadpan goofiness with Airplane! and The Naked Gun, while director Rob Reiner and his company of players popularized mockumentary humor with This Is Spinal Tap in 1984. </p>
          <p>A new crop of auteurs brought quirky, often dark comedies to the screen in the late ’80s and ’90s, from Wes Anderson’s visually rich Bill Murray vehicles to the Coen brothers classics Raising Arizona and Fargo. At the same time, the Farrelly brothers raised the “gross-out” bar set by Animal House, with hits like Dumb and Dumber and There’s Something About Mary paving the way for raunchy comedies to come.</p>
          <p>In the new millennium, film comedy fully embraced its slapstick roots, with actors Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, and Sacha Baron Cohen playing outlandish protagonists who fall, fumble, and get hit in the family jewels. Director Judd Apatow brought a sweeter self-deprecation to bro humor in films like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, while Edgar Wright redefined “bromance” with spoofs such as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, both starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.</p>
          <p>Within this male-dominated world, female directors also began finding box office success. In 1982, Amy Heckerling directed Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and went on to write and direct Clueless, while Penelope Spheeris helmed Wayne’s World in 1992. Acclaimed screenwriters Nora Ephron and Nancy Meyers also stepped into the director’s chair, with hits like Sleepless in Seattle and Something’s Gotta Give, respectively. Both Sofia Coppola and Greta Gerwig received Best Director Oscar nominations for their comedic films—a sign of potentially widening cracks in Hollywood’s glass ceiling.</p>
          <h2>Comic Strips</h2>
          <p>The impact of comic strips on the tone of modern comedy is often overlooked. Li’l Abner by Al Capp and Pogo by Walt Kelly used hillbillies and swamp creatures as metaphors to address issues like McCarthyism and social protest. Charles Schulz’s Peanuts was a revelation when it debuted in 1950, stunning readers with its themes of alienation, hopelessness, and existential angst. </p>
          <p>Jules Feiffer’s Sick Sick Sick was one of the first comic strips to target an intellectual audience. It was considered part of the “sick comedy” movement that included nightclub comedians Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, and Nichols and May. When a new stand-up named Woody Allen burst onto the scene, reviewers said he was “straight out of the Jules Feiffer playbook.”</p>
          <p>MAD magazine, which debuted in 1952, showcased the creative anarchy of artists Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, and Don Martin, among others. MAD was marketed as a humor magazine for the preteen set, but its counterculture tone informed later cartoonists like Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. Comedians Ernie Kovacs, Henry Morgan, Stan Freberg, and Bob and Ray occasionally contributed to MAD, and many writers on The Simpsons have cited the magazine’s influence.</p>
          <p>The popularity of comic strips peaked in the mid-20th century as Americans gradually turned from newspapers to television news. The enduring exception is political cartooning, from Garry Trudeau’s long-running Doonesbury to Ruben Bolling’s satirical Tom the Dancing Bug, which gained prominence online during the Bush-Cheney years.</p>
          <h2>Stand-Up </h2>
          <p>Though the roots of stand-up stretch back to the days when Mark Twain traveled the world, retelling his stories for money and laughs, stand-up comics truly emerged on the vaudeville stage. Vaudevillian Frank Fay was among the first performers to get laughs simply by talking, without relying on pratfalls, costumes, or props. His style, revolutionary for its time, was emulated by young comedians including Jack Benny, Milton Berle, and Bob Hope.</p>
          <p>After vaudeville houses shuttered during the Great Depression, comics such as Jack Carter, Myron Cohen, Buddy Hackett, and Alan King honed their stand-up skills at resorts in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Many also worked in the Mafia-owned nightclubs of the era, and it’s believed the Mob coined the term “stand-up comic,” meaning a dependable comedian who could stand and deliver one punch line after another. </p>
          <p>Stand-up material remained largely generic and impersonal until the mid-1950s, when Lenny Bruce revolutionized the genre with his provocative first-person monologues. Along with fellow trailblazers Mort Sahl and Jonathan Winters, Bruce paved the way for smart, satirical comics such as Bob Newhart, Shelley Berman, and Dick Gregory. The no-holds-barred honesty of this new “sick comedy” also heavily influenced George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Lily Tomlin, the defining stand-up comics of the ’60s counterculture generation. </p>
          <p>By the 1970s, stand-up comedians were akin to rock stars, with acts like Steve Martin and Cheech & Chong selling out concert venues and drawing rowdy crowds. Comedy clubs opened across America, from Catch A Rising Star in New York to the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, showcasing future stars Robin Williams, Freddy Prinze, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others. </p>
          <p>Stand-up was everywhere in the 1980s—radio, cable TV, even suburban strip malls—and comics Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby spun their success into prime-time television shows. Eddie Murphy, with his raunchy yet charismatic style, was the most popular stand-up comic of the decade, but older comedians such as George Burns, Rodney Dangerfield, and Joan Rivers also reinvented themselves for new audiences. It was a massive comedy boom, but oversaturation spelled its downfall. By the 1990s, hundreds of once-thriving clubs had closed. </p>
          <p>“Alternative comedy” rose from the ashes, led by arty comics who often performed for free at open mic events in bookstores, Laundromats, and other offbeat venues. Among these newcomers were then-unknowns David Cross, Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and Sarah Silverman.</p>
          <p>A few tenacious comics from the 1980s, including Jon Stewart, Louis C.K., and Chris Rock, held on and emerged as major players in the early 21st century. Stand-up comedy continued to provide a springboard for film and television careers, launching stars such as Amy Schumer and Pete Holmes. In the era of Netflix, YouTube, and stand-up–obsessed podcasts, the genre has become more accessible than ever.</p>
          <h2>Improv</h2>
          <p>Acting teacher Viola Spolin helped pioneer the techniques of modern American improv in the 1930s, as part of a WPA program designed to teach theater to underprivileged children and recent immigrants. Spolin used what she called “theater games” to help her students focus, react spontaneously, and incorporate their diverse experiences into a collaborative whole. </p>
          <p>In the early 1950s, Spolin’s son, Paul Sills, took his mother’s theater games and developed improvisational comedy, together with David Shepherd, Elaine May, Mike Nichols, Alan Alda, and Shelley Berman. Their Chicago-based improv troupe, the Compass Players, eventually evolved into the legendary Second City.</p>
          <p>Unfamiliar with the techniques of improv, audiences were both baffled and dazzled by Second City’s spontaneous bursts of comic genius. The troupe produced some of America’s best-known comics and later became the primary recruiting ground for sketch programs like Saturday Night Live. Notable Second City alumni include Bill Murray, John Candy, Mike Myers, Stephen Colbert, and Tina Fey.</p>
          <p>New comedy collectives followed Second City’s lead. Among the most successful were the Upright Citizens Brigade, co-founded by Amy Poehler, and the Groundlings, whose early members included Tracy and Laraine Newman. These groups offered classes, training, and a development program for new generations of talent. Once an industry secret, improv techniques went mainstream with the success of television programs like Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p>
          <h2>Sketch Comedy</h2>
          <p>For many years, sketch comedy was primarily presented as part of a Broadway revue—a variety show whose songs and sketches followed a theme rather than a story line. Many sketch comedians of the early television era, including Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason, Imogene Coca, Buddy Hackett, and Carl Reiner, first honed their craft on these shows. In the 1950s, Caesar largely dominated sketch comedy, with help from Reiner, Coca, and a stellar writing team that included Mel Brooks and Neil Simon. Compared to the more cerebral humor of Your Show of Shows and Caesar’s Hour, The Red Skelton Show was viewed as less sophisticated—the very reason, some argue, that Skelton’s program lasted for 20 years.</p>
          <p>In the late 1960s, Carol Burnett became the first woman to host a hit sketch show, with a versatile ensemble that included Tim Conway and Harvey Korman. By contrast, Lorne Michaels envisioned his new program, Saturday Night Live, as the youthful, edgy antithesis to mainstream comedy. From its premiere in 1975, SNL went on to become the most successful sketch show in television history.</p>
          <p>The absurdist humor of Monty Python’s Flying Circus also turned the form on its head, making it easily the most influential sketch program of its day. SNL, SCTV, The Kids in the Hall, Mr. Show, and The State all benefited from the Monty Python influence.</p>
          <p>In Living Color ushered in a new era of representation in sketch comedy during the 1990s, showcasing a wide variety of Black talent previously excluded from the genre. The Wayans brothers were its creative force, helping to launch the careers of Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, while luring comedians like Chris Rock away from SNL.</p>
          <p>With the rise of Comedy Central, programs like Chappelle’s Show, Key and Peele, Kroll Show, and Inside Amy Schumer stood on the shoulders of their predecessors, further evolving the sketch format. </p>
          <h2>Television</h2>
          <p>Early experiments with television broadcasting began in the late 1920s and continued throughout the 1930s with marginal results. Comic actors like Morey Amsterdam and Mary Wickes were used in test broadcasts, but their audience was severely limited, as few people owned television sets at the time.During World War II, commercial television development was halted and the technology was commandeered by the military. When the war ended, restrictions were lifted and television’s first major comedy shows aired. Texaco Star Theatre made Milton Berle a household name in 1948, while Toast of the Town did the same for Ed Sullivan and the many stand-up comedians he presented.</p>

          <p>In 1950, NBC broke into late-night comedy with the variety show Broadway Open House, hosted by comedians Jerry Lester and Morey Amsterdam. In 1954, the network introduced an early version of The Tonight Show, with host Steve Allen. Allen’s successor, Jack Paar, created the classic late-night formula: an opening monologue and a host conducting interviews from behind a desk. Subsequent hosts Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, and Jimmy Fallon continued the pattern. Hosting a late-night show became a goal for many aspiring comedians—one realized by David Letterman, Joan Rivers, and Arsenio Hall, among others. </p>

          <p>Starting in the late 1940s, sitcoms became the cornerstone of television comedy. Along with I Love Lucy, which made Lucille Ball a TV powerhouse, pinnacles of 1950s television included The Honeymooners and The Phil Silvers Show. In the 1960s, The Andy Griffith Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show were highly respected, while the new relevancy of All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show spoke to the cultural tensions and changing mores of the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Sitcoms largely followed the same template until the mid-’80s, when Moonlighting began playing with form, making it the rare program to meld both traditional and experimental styles. In 1992, The Larry Sanders Show, starring Garry Shandling, introduced the behind-the-scenes style later embraced by The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Modern Family. </p>
          <h2>Animation</h2>
          <p>In 1914, Winsor McCay created one of the earliest American animated cartoons, Gertie the Dinosaur, and toured the vaudeville circuit with it. McCay projected Gertie onto a screen and pretended to command and even feed the dinosaur—a stunt that mystified audiences of the time.</p>
          <p>By the 1920s, cartoons were common in movie theaters. Max Fleischer’s Out of the Inkwell series paved the way for his most successful projects, Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor, the latter adapted from E.C. Segar’s comic strip. </p>
          <p>Walt Disney became the darling of Hollywood and helped usher in the age of sound with animated cartoons such as Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse’s iconic screen debut. Warner Bros. delighted audiences with Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and other famous characters overseen by animation funnymen Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng.</p>
          <p>Beginning in 1940, animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera created Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts for MGM, honing the tricks they later brought with them to television. Their Hanna-Barbera company produced the animated series Top Cat—a satire of the popular Phil Silvers Show—and The Flintstones, which reimagined The Honeymooners in the Stone Age. </p>
          <p>In the late 1950s and early ’60s, Jay Ward hired comedy writers to script subversive material for his Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon shows. Many of these same writers went on to create hits like Barney Miller and The Mary Tyler Moore Show.</p>
          <p>Animation reached a nadir in the 1970s and ’80s, when it was seen primarily as an uninspired medium for children’s programming. This changed after The Simpsons appeared as a segment on The Tracey Ullman Show, a sketch program on the new Fox television network. The Simpsons spun off into its own series and became an immediate—and controversial—sensation. A spate of adult-oriented animation followed, led by The Ren & Stimpy Show, Beavis and Butt-Head, South Park, Family Guy, and the comedy smorgasbord Adult Swim.</p>
          <p>Feature-length animation underwent a similar renaissance, with Disney’s Aladdin marking a shift toward more sophisticated comedy in 1992. Featuring the manic improvisations of Robin Williams, the film jump-started the trend of comedians voicing animated characters, from Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, to Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as an ogre and a donkey in Shrek.</p>
          <h2>Internet</h2>
          <p>Early internet humor was largely limited to stock jokes that were printed out and passed around the office. When the Wisconsin-based satirical newspaper the Onion took its fake headlines and tongue-in-cheek articles online in 1996, the web had one of its first comedic hits.</p>
          <p>Beginning in the late 1990s, initial forays into online video included Flash animation by Spümcø, the company behind The Ren & Stimpy Show, and the cartoon series Homestar Runner. A Wild West atmosphere prevailed, and lo-fi, sharable memes—from rapping bananas to dancing babies—often became overnight sensations.</p>
          <p>Online comedy didn’t truly take off until video technology was simplified and perfected by YouTube in 2005. Immediately after the website launched, an unauthorized upload of “Lazy Sunday”—a Saturday Night Live sketch by the Lonely Island comedy troupe—went viral, putting both Andy Samberg and YouTube on the map.</p>
          <p>Although acclaimed projects such as Bad Lip Reading and Between Two Ferns were designed specifically for the web, the majority of internet comedy soon grew to resemble traditional television. Netflix and Amazon essentially functioned as online networks, and some TV programs, such as Saturday Night Live and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, circumvented bootleggers by uploading segments and even full episodes for free.</p>
          <p>Of all internet genres, podcasting has encouraged the most cross-pollination with traditional comedy, attracting both established comics and young upstarts with its low cost, wide reach, and opportunities for creative control. Shows like like WTF with Marc Maron, 2 Dope Queens, and Comedy Bang! Bang! have gained fans by combining candid, long-form interviews with sketch and improv routines such as  Nerdist, Earwold, and All Things Comedy have further expanded audiences and amplified revenue, turning podcasting from a n indie art from to a comedy juggernaut.</p>

          <h1>Funny Papers</h1>
          <p>Brad Anderson, the creator of the long-running Marmaduke comic strip, was born in Jamestown, New York, in 1924, and raised in the nearby town of Portland.</p>

          <p>Created by Anderson in 1954, Marmaduke tells the story of a lovable Great Dane and his family, the Winslows. Syndicated for over seven decades, the strip appeared in more than 500 newspapers around the world—and was often based on experiences in Anderson's real life in Chautauqua County.</p> 

          <p>The items exhibited here were gathered from Anderson’s studio and arranged to approximate the experience of looking in on the artist at work. The Sunday page featured on Anderson’s light board shows a Fourth of July scene at Midway State Park, on the shore of Chautauqua Lake. The drawing board was gifted to Anderson by his parents when he was a high school student and used throughout his entire artistic career.</p>

          <h1>Radio Booths</h1>
          <h2>1930s to 1940s: The Golden Age of Radio</h2>

          <p>The 1930s ushered in a golden age on the airwaves, as vaudeville theaters shuttered and radio became the primary medium for comics such as Fred Allen, Bob Hope, and George Burns and Gracie Allen. Their early comedy programs, along with sitcoms like Amos ’n’ Andy, provided a marvelous distraction from the Great Depression—and later, World War II.</p>


          <h2>1950s: Rebels with a Cause</h2>

          <p>The 1950s were a time of transition for radio, as television rose to prominence and began siphoning off talent and audiences. The upside? Wildly inventive comics like Stan Freberg and Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding were able to step into the void, bringing their offbeat sensibilities and subversive humor to the airwaves.</p>


          <h2>1970s: Comedy and the Counterculture</h2>

          <p>FM radio became commercially successful in the early 1970s, with DJs appealing to pot-smoking counterculture types by playing long tracks off rock ’n’ roll LPs. A similar demographic tuned in for the manic satire of The National Lampoon Radio Hour, as well as surreal performances by the Firesign Theatre and Credibility Gap comedy troupes.</p>

          <h2>1980s: Big Hair and Big Names</h2>

          <p>Larger-than- life personalities drove radio comedy in the 1980s. The Dr. Demento Show introduced the antics of “Weird Al” Yankovic, while morning show hosts Don Imus and Howard Stern earned laughs and notoriety with their provocative character sketches and stunts. Major comics such as Don Rickles, Garry Shandling, and Albert Brooks also gave radio interviews, providing new insights into the inner workings of comedy.</p>


          <h2>Late ’90s to Now: Comedians Talk Story</h2>

          <p>In the modern era of radio, comedians are in demand for their insights as much as their jokes. An interview on The Howard Stern Show carries major cachet, while This American Life, with host Ira Glass, has made its mark by airing thoughtful stories from humorists such as David Sedaris, Sarah Vowell, and Dave Eggers.</p>

          <h1>Sounds Funny</h1>
          <p>What makes the best comedy so funny?</p>

          <p>Along with well-crafted jokes, unforgettable performances, and clever sight gags, another key element deserves credit for the laughs: sound! From the visceral squish of pie meeting face, to the exaggerated kaboom in a classic cartoon, sound effects make comic moments more believable and absurd situations more hilarious. They are the salt and pepper of comedy, enhancing the flavor of almost every humorous scene.</p>

          <p>The art of sound design remains a mysterious process to many, as it occurs in darkened recording studios and behind the closed doors of Foley stages. Foley artists, named after sound pioneer Jack Foley, re-create everything from stealthy footsteps to sucker punches, perfectly syncing their movements with picture. Timing is key, but so is ingenuity. When Fred Flintstone’s feet start his car, we’re actually hearing hands slapping a leather couch. And when a spine cracks in The Big Lebowski, the sound comes from the crunch of celery being twisted.</p>

          <p>While Foley artists typically perform their effects, sound designers build sound tracks using a combination of stock effects, field recordings, and sounds created from scratch. The process is painstaking—and often highly creative. For Toy Story 2, the rasp of Wheezy the penguin involved combining a squeak toy with the sound of air being blown through a clarinet mouthpiece. The slurpy greetings that Woody receives from his horse came from real-life recordings of a cow licking peanut butter off someone’s face.</p>

          <p>Mixed seamlessly together with dialogue and music, these effects create the soundscapes underpinning some of the funniest moments in film and television. The comic impact is deeply felt but rarely noticed—which means the men and women of sound design are doing their jobs perfectly.</p>

          <h1>Lyrical Laughter</h1>

          <h2>The Marriage of Comedy and Music</h2>

          <p>As an art form, musical comedy spans generations and crosses genres. It’s a hallmark of classic sketch shows like Monty Python’s Flying Circus and Saturday Night Live, where characters frequently and absurdly break into song. Parody artists from “Weird Al” Yankovic to the Lonely Island perfectly mimic musical groups to hilarious effect, while satirists often use music to share social and political commentary—whether that’s South Park characters singing about American hypocrisy or Mel Brooks mocking Hitler with a song-and-dance routine.</p>

          <p>What makes comedy and music such an enduring combination? Perhaps it’s the blend of catchy melodies and clever lyrics, or the contrast of sophisticated rhythms and shocking punch lines. Musical comedy also offers an emotional experience, a direct line of communication between artist and audience. Singing along, tapping our toes, laughing at shared references, we are wonderfully in on the joke.</p>

          <p>Shelley Berman’s career began at Chicago’s Goodman Theatre, where he was trained as a dramatic actor. Berman was invited to join the Compass Players: the innovative Chicago-based improvisational troupe that would go on to become The Second City. While performing with the Compass Players, Shelley Berman developed a solo act employing an imaginary telephone. He auditioned the routine at the legendary Mister Kelly’s in 1957 and vaulted to immediate acclaim.</p>
          <p> Berman’s early performances led to nightclub engagements across the country, countless TV appearances, and a recording contract with Verve Records. Inside Shelley Berman - released in early 1959 - was the first comedy album to be awarded a Gold Record (displayed here), and the first non-musical recording to win a Grammy Award. Shelley Berman was the first stand-up comedian booked to play Carnegie Hall.</p>

          <p>Shelley Berman’s unique brand of anxiety-ridden observational humor helped to redefine stand-up comedy in the late 1950s and ‘60s. </p>

          <p>“Shelley Berman came along with that whole new wave of comedy. It forever changed the way we look at stand-up comedy.”</p>
          <p>—Fred Willard</p>

          <p>Berman continued to perform comedy across the country, and appeared consistently on Broadway, in films, and on television until 2014. In 2008, he received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Nat David, Larry David’s father, on <u>Curb Your Enthusiasm</u>. Berman authored four books, two plays, and numerous poems, and taught humor writing at USC for over twenty years.</p>

          <p>Shelley Berman carefully stored creative records in his home office for seven decades. The material was arranged in filing cabinets and itemized using a Rolodex, whose entries are labeled with dates ranging from the 1940s to 2010s. The cabinets contain thousands of pages that not only chronicle the career of a pioneering comedic artist, but the broader history of comedy across the second half of the 20th century. In hundreds of photographs, calendars, contracts, and correspondences, Berman’s archive tracks the development of modern stand-up comedy in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the rise of the comedic recording industry (in which he played an early and instrumental role).</p>
          <p>So precise and purposeful was Shelley Berman’s comedy, that he carried a custom-built stool with him from gig to gig as he travelled across the country performing his act. As a “sit-down” stand-up, Berman organized his act around this particular seat (with a carefully placed rung upon which to perch his feet) so that he would not be distracted by rickety stools of variable heights that might be found backstage at comedy clubs. After each show, he disassembled it with a portable toolkit and packed it in a metal case, now marked with airline stickers from his many trips to nightclubs across the country.</p>

          <p>At a moment when representations of women in professional creative roles were few and far between, Rose Marie’s confident, intelligent, and very funny portrayal of comedy writer Sally Rogers on The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961-1966) galvanized a generation. </p>

          <p>“Gloria Steinem famously said ‘You have to see it to be it.’ And Rose Marie’s portrayal of Sally Rogers was what made so many women believe that we could be comedy writers. Rose Marie was a feminist role model who made us all laugh. That’s a legacy that’s hard to beat.” </p>
          <p>—Nell Scovell</p>

          <p>“She was fast, and strong. What I saw, as a young girl, was a brazenly funny, professional, independent career woman who held her own in a workplace full of men.”</p>
          <p>—Paula Poundstone</p>

          <p>“Baby Rose Marie” was a vaudeville headliner, coast-to-coast radio host, and successful recording artist by the age of five. She entertained Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt, and starred in some of the first “talking films,” including the 1929 Vitaphone short Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder. In 1946, Rose Marie became the First Lady of Vegas when Bugsy Siegel booked her as the historic opening act at his casino-hotel, The Flamingo. </p>

          <p>Rose Marie’s prolific nine-decade career, spanning the 1920s until her death in 2017, is considered one of the longest and most versatile in entertainment history. In a collection of dozens of meticulously prepared scrapbooks, Rose Marie chronicled every facet of 20th century American entertainment from her unique first hand perspective. Always armed with a camera and a pen, she recorded the now-elusive histories of vaudeville, radio, live theater, and early television as she lived them. These scrapbooks contain hundreds of never-before-seen photographs, rare memorabilia, and correspondence with paragons of American comedy from the 1920s to 2000s.</p>

          <p><u>Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In</u> was a groundbreaking sketch-comedy series. The hyper-paced NBC show ran from 1968 to 1973, and introduced a style of chaotic, politically fearless humor that’s still popular today. </p>

Running from 1992 to 1998, it featured a naturalistic blend of drama and humor—a distinctive style that would reappear in shows like <u>The Office</u> and <u>30 Rock</u>.

          <h1>Lenny Bruce</h1>

          <p>A legendary comedian and fierce iconoclast, Lenny Bruce revolutionized stand-up in the 1950s. At the time, most comics were still reciting tame routines and generic jokes. By contrast, Bruce’s sets were wild acts of self-expression, full of personal confession, improvised rants, and raw observations on sex, race, religion, and politics. </p>

          <p>Bruce’s insistence on pushing the boundaries of language, content, and form ushered in a new era of cerebral, artistic stand-up. It also invited controversy. By the early 1960s, the media had dubbed Bruce the leader of a “sick comedy” movement that included fellow comics such as Mort Sahl and Shelley Berman. </p>

          <p>Bruce soon became the target of local vice squads, conservative police departments, and even religious factions, all of which tried to end his career. Despite numerous arrests, he continued his no-holds-barred attacks on hypocrisy and complacency, until his death in 1966. Over half a century later, Bruce’s intelligence and irreverence still echo across the American comedy landscape.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Bruce was always a prolific writer, an unconventional trait at a time when most comics hired outside people to develop their jokes. Along with crafting his own stand-up material, his written work included screenplays, pamphlets, essays, short stories, and teleplays.</p>

          <p>In the mid-1950s, Bruce found a new level of success as a screenwriter. He was hired to punch up the Donald O’Connor musical Walking My Baby Back Home; he sold a treatment to Alfred Hitchcock Presents; and he wrote several B movies, including 1953’s Dance Hall Racket, which he also starred in, and 1954’s The Rocket Man.</p>

          <p>Image of Lenny Bruce.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>By the late 1950s, Lenny Bruce had become a sought-after essayist for publications such as Rogue magazine and The Realist. He had a recurring column in Rogue called Bruce Here, in which his trademark “sick” social satire took many forms. One of his favorite formats: Brief screenplays full of absurd exchanges and a cast of characters that sometimes included a heightened version of himself.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>By the early 1960s, Lenny Bruce was a cultural phenomenon. His many television appearances, half a dozen comedy albums, and regular club performances had brought his unique brand of humor into the national spotlight. With notoriety, however, came increased attention from the authorities.</p>

          <p>Bruce was first arrested on obscenity charges in 1961, for saying cocksucker at San Francisco’s Jazz Workshop. Though he was eventually acquitted, he was arrested twice in Los Angeles the following year, then sentenced to a year in prison on charges stemming from a performance in Chicago. While out on bail, Bruce attempted to perform at a club in London, but was taken to the airport and deported to the United States. </p>

          <p>In 1964, Bruce began a run at Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village. One night in early April, he was handcuffed by undercover detectives just before going onstage. A petition protesting his arrest was signed by more than 80 prominent figures—including Paul Newman, Bob Dylan, Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, and John Updike—but the case still went to court that June.</p>

          <p>The highly publicized trial that ensued became a historic test of First Amendment rights. The case featured prominent witnesses, impassioned testimony, and a recess during which Bruce was hospitalized for acute chest inflammation. When the defense finally rested, it would be another 99 days before the court announced its verdict. </p>

          <p>It was during this time that Bruce crafted the statement seen below—an impassioned plea that was delivered to Judge Murtagh. On December 16, 1964, Murtagh sentenced Bruce to four months in the workhouse. Bruce remained free on bond during his appeal.</p>

          <p>Unfolding during his court case in New York, Lenny Bruce’s 1964 trial in California took place without him being present. </p>

          <p>Although the case was ultimately decided in Bruce’s favor, these original transcripts reveal how the court was forced to consider a new morality in an era now synonymous with emerging liberal culture.</p>

          <p>“Four years working in clubs—that’s what really made it for me—every night: doing it, doing, doing it, getting bored and doing different ways, no pressure on you, and all the other comedians are drunken bums who don’t show up, so I could try anything.” </p>
          <p>—Lenny Bruce </p>

          <p>In 1964, Lenny Bruce was writing essays for Playboy magazine when publisher Hugh Hefner commissioned him to write a memoir. Bruce largely dictated his autobiography to his friend Paul Krassner, a writer and counterculture icon who published the satirical underground paper The Realist. The two traveled around the country, working on the manuscript backstage each night before Bruce performed. The resulting memoir—its title a parody of the 1936 bestseller How to Win Friends and Influence People—was serialized in Playboy, whetting appetites for the book’s official publication in 1965.</p>

          <p>With its breezy style and piercing anecdotes, How to Talk Dirty and Influence People is uniquely Bruce. As seen in the early manuscript on display here, handwritten notes intermingle with the comedian’s words-capturing his intent to balance jokes and humorous observations with memories from his childhood and reflections on time spent with nightclub comics and Hollywood celebrities.</p>

          <p>Bruce died in 1966, less than a year after his autobiography’s official release. How to Talk Dirty and Influence People has remained in print ever since.</p>

          <h1>Art of the Roast</h1>

          <h2>Birth of the Roast</h2>

          <p>Roasts are mainstays of modern comedy, respected and attended by some of the biggest celebrities of our time. Although seen by millions today, these bawdy tributes began as invitation-only events, held behind the closed doors of the Friars Club. Founded in 1904 by a group of press agents, the Friars Club quickly evolved into a premier New York City social club for comedians and other entertainers. Members would honor their own with formal testimonial dinners, where speakers were invited to heap compliments on the guest of honor.</p>
          <p>Almost inevitably, good-natured ribbing began appearing among the kudos. Speakers would toss in a gentle barb here and an endearing insult there, and eventually their toasts contained more punch than praise—not to mention plenty of profanity. By 1950, these obscene, hilarious dinners had become an institution. Thus, the roast was born, as was the Friars’ new motto, “We only roast the ones we love.”</p>

          <h2>Hail to the Roast</h2>

          <p>When it comes to roasts, no one is off-limits—as the White House Correspondents’ Association proves with its annual roast of the U.S. president. Three years after these dinners began in 1921, Calvin Coolidge became the first president to attend. Jokes at the president’s expense were initially just a portion of the evening’s entertainment, but by the 1980s, the major focus had shifted to comedians skewering the commander in chief. </p>
          <p>In 2006, the Bush administration was incensed by barbs like this from Stephen Colbert: “The greatest thing about this man is he’s steady. . . . He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter what happened Tuesday.” </p>
          <p>President Donald Trump skipped his own roast in 2017, but that didn’t deter host Hasan Minhaj from fulfilling his duties: “The news coming out of the White House is so stressful I’ve been watching House of Cards just to relax.”</p>


          <h2>Roasts Make a Comeback</h2>

          <p>In 1998, Comedy Central resurrected the roast, airing a Friars Club tribute to Drew Carey. The broadcast not only revived the tradition on television, but introduced a younger audience to the art of friendly skewering. After airing five Friars Club roasts, the network began producing its own shows in 2003, with Denis Leary as the first “victim.”</p>
          <p>Comedy Central’s no-holds-barred style proved highly popular. At the roast for comedian Bob Saget, actress Cloris Leachman earned high marks for her announcement: “I am not here to roast Bob Saget. I’m here to fuck John Stamos.”
          </p>
          <p>Charlie Sheen got burned twice in one night when his roast aired an hour after his character was killed off on the sitcom Two and a Half Men. Amy Schumer marked the occasion by firing off this shot at Sheen: “You’re just like Bruce Willis—you were big in the ’80s and now your old slot’s being filled with Ashton Kutcher.”</p>


          <h2>Too Hot to Handle</h2>

          <p>Though roasts are notorious for off-color humor, they occasionally blast through boundaries and cross into cringe territory. The roastmaster typically keeps the show moving, but Ted Danson skidded out of control when he appeared in blackface to host Whoopi Goldberg’s Friars Club roast in 1993. Six years later, comedian Jeff Ross earned shocked laughter when he responded to Sandra Bernhard’s awkward serenade of Friars Club roastee Jerry Stiller. Said Ross: “Sandra Bernhard, holy shit! I wouldn’t fuck Sandra Bernhard with Bea Arthur’s dick!”</p>
          <p>At the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber in 2015, guest roaster Snoop Dogg dropped “nigga” on the bemused pop star no fewer than 19 times in a two-minute stretch—an achievement in button-pushing. But perhaps nobody has been hit as hard as conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who probably should have thought twice before agreeing to help roast Rob Lowe on Comedy Central in 2016. Host David Spade was just one of many taking jabs at Coulter: “She seems stiff and conservative, but Ann gets wild in the sheets—just ask the Klan.” </p>
          <p>No matter how pointed the barbs or how low the blows, at the end of the day, a roast is a roast. Everyone is fair game, and your only defense is a big laugh at your own expense.</p>

          <h2>Fanning the Flames</h2>

          <p>Roasts entered the mainstream—and became immensely popular—when Dean Martin added them to his weekly TV variety show in 1973. Sanitized and censored for television, these events poked fun at comedians, actors, and politicians, with jabs like this one from Don Rickles to Ronald Reagan: “Black, white, Jew, gentile, we’re all working for one cause: to figure out how you became governor.” </p>
          <p>After The Dean Martin Show was canceled in 1974, Martin began hosting a series of specials christened The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. Martin himself often led the charge, even taking aim at fellow roaster Don Rickles: “Don’s idea of a fun evening is to show home movies of the attack on Pearl Harbor—with a laugh track.” Over the course of a decade, Martin’s specials brought roasts to a wide audience and put a spotlight on the proud tradition, which quietly continued behind the doors of the Friars Club.</p>

          <h2>Ladies of the Roast</h2>

          <p>Although women weren’t officially admitted to the Friars Club until 1988, Lucille Ball joined the ranks of the roasted in 1961. After reminding the crowd to treat her like a lady, Johnny Carson introduced her as “Lucille Testicle.” Fed up with hearing the boys whisper about what went on inside the club, Phyllis Diller dressed up as a man and sneaked into Sid Caesar’s roast in 1983. Diller said afterward, “It was the funniest, dirtiest thing I ever heard in my life.”</p>
          <p>The Dean Martin Show was the first to roast a woman on television, airing a tribute to Bette Davis in 1973. Female comedians have also slung their share of put-downs. In 2010, veteran roaster Lisa Lampanelli—known as the “Queen of Mean”—razzed Baywatch star David Hasselhoff about his drinking: “[His] liver is so black, it’s fucking two of the Kardashian sisters.” </p>
          <p>Women don’t pull punches when lampooning other women either, as evidenced by Whitney Cummings’s roast of Joan Rivers: “Look at Joan. I’ve always wanted to know what Ivana Trump would look like if she was dating Chris Brown.” After being excluded for decades, women quickly demonstrated they could dish it out—and take it—as well as men.</p>

        </article>
        <article id="taboo">
          <h1>History of Taboo</h1>
          <p>An old notion suggests that it’s impolite to discuss sex, religion, or politics at a dinner party. And for much of the history of American comedy, those same topics—and a few more—have been off-limits. Sometimes there were explicit bans and censorship; other times the taboos were unstated but understood. </p>
          <p>Of course, once something is deemed unacceptable, it becomes seductively enticing to comedians. Comics are constantly pushing the limits to see what they can get away with. Often they’ll use wordplay, innuendo, and satire to test out a topic, eventually addressing the most taboo of subjects directly, repeatedly, ferociously. </p>
          <p>Though sometimes the intent is simply to be shocking, many comedians believe boundary-breaking material serves a larger purpose. “Comedy puts light onto darkness,” says stand-up Sarah Silverman. “Darkness can’t live where there’s light. So that’s why it’s important to talk about things that are taboo. Otherwise they just stay in the dark and become dangerous.”</p>
          <h2>Vaudeville: The Sunday School Circuit</h2>
          <p>Early vaudeville arose to compete with burlesque, offering a clean alternative to the more vulgar entertainments that flourished after the Civil War. Benjamin Franklin Keith and his partner, Edward Albee, became the most successful and powerful vaudeville producers of the era, in part by merciless enforcement of prudish standards. “We believed in soap and water,” Albee once said, “and in strict censorship of the stage.”</p>
          <p>A backstage note to Keith-Albee performers said: “You are hereby warned that your act must be free from all vulgarity and suggestiveness in words, actions, and costumes.” The so-called Sunday School Circuit banned terms such as liar, slob, son-of-a-gun, and even pants—the acceptable term being trousers. Comedians who tried to sneak a risqué word or line into their act would receive a note, delivered in a blue envelope, telling them to cut the offending language. Off-color material would forever after be referred to as “blue.”</p>
          <h2>Prohibition: Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It</h2>
          <p>There was delicious irony in using the term Prohibition to describe an era that winked at many previously taboo behaviors. As urbanites began flocking to speakeasies and cabarets to circumvent the nationwide ban on alcohol, they also began flouting conventional mores and even developing a taste for camp. In the early 1930s, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco reveled in the Pansy Craze. The smart set thronged to nightspots to enjoy bawdy songs and revues put on by drag queens and other gay performers, including Jean Malin, the acerbic, tuxedo-wearing star of New York’s Club Abbey. </p>
          <p>In 1927, Broadway actress Mae West wrote a play called The Drag about a closeted socialite. The comedy was banned after 10 performances, but West became a gay icon and continued to elevate innuendo to an art form. In the 1933 film I’m No Angel, she banters with Cary Grant, who tells her, “You were wonderful tonight.” West: “I’m always wonderful at night.” Grant: “Yes, but tonight you were especially good.” West: “When I’m good, I’m very good. But when I’m bad, I’m better.” </p>
          <p>That sort of sharp double-entendre dialogue drove the major studios to initiate strict enforcement of the Hays Code in 1934. The code banned nudity, ridicule of religion, and reference to sexual “perversion,” among many other things. It also proscribed words such as nuts (except when used to describe a crazy person), fanny, fairy, lousy, slut, and . . . pansy.</p>
          <h2>The Bawdy Politic</h2>
          <p>In many parts of the world, comedians who joke about their country’s leader get arrested. In the United States, they get laughs. Even the sainted Abraham Lincoln was savagely lampooned during his presidency. </p>
          <p>Hollywood films and early radio both had the ability to reach national audiences, which were likely to be divided on any political commentary. In 1936, NBC sent a memo to stations warning them to avoid references to a recent Supreme Court decision. “All comedians,” the memo declared more broadly, “must refrain from political comments.” Before the United States entered World War II, radio networks and movie studios sometimes blocked comic jabs at Adolf Hitler, afraid of riling the German Americans in their audiences.</p>
          <p>During the Red Scare of the late 1940s and ’50s, comic actors including Zero Mostel and Jack Gilford and writers such as Ring Lardner Jr. were barred from working in Hollywood because of their former affiliations with the Communist Party. “I am a man of a thousand faces,” Mostel said, “all of them blacklisted.” The FBI also kept tabs on stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx, thanks to their progressive political views. </p>
          <p>CBS took the Smothers Brothers’ hit variety show off the air in 1969 in no small part because of the outspoken pair’s antiwar politics. Years later, stand-up Bill Maher enraged many in the days immediately after 9/11. “We have been the cowards,” Maher said, “lobbing missiles from 2,000 miles away. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building—say what you want about it—not cowardly.” ABC canceled Maher’s show, which was aptly named Politically Incorrect.</p>
          <h2>Sick, Sick, Sick</h2>
          <p>In the mid-1950s, a new style of comedy emerged, marked by its conversational approach to social commentary and political satire. It delighted some and incensed others. Time famously called the trend “sick comedy,” saying, “They attack motherhood, childhood, adulthood, sainthood.” The magazine tagged Mort Sahl as “the original sicknik.” </p>
          <p>When Sahl first took the stage at San Francisco’s hungry i nightclub in 1953, he was something completely new. He worked with a rolled-up newspaper as his only prop and riffed on the headlines. “Every time the Russians throw an American in jail,” he observed, “the [House Un-American Activities] Committee throws an American in jail to get even.” </p>
          <p>If Sahl was the conscience of the New Wave comedians, Lenny Bruce was their unfettered id. He revolutionized stand-up by addressing the taboo subjects of religion, racism, and sex, and his routines typically featured words like shit, fuck, cocksucker, and—perhaps most shocking of all—nigger. “It’s the suppression of the word [nigger] that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness,” Bruce said. His most radical contribution to comedy, however, may have been going onstage and simply talking about himself. </p>
          <h2>Fairy Tales</h2>
          <p>For decades, entertainment censors objected to anything that might suggest homosexuality. It wasn’t that they disliked the ridicule and gay-bashing that had flourished in burlesque comedy; they simply wanted to avoid any acknowledgment that gays and lesbians existed. One NBC censor complained in 1938 that many radio comedians, including Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and George Burns and Gracie Allen, relied on jokes about “effeminate gentlemen or sex-perverted characters.”</p>
          <p>Rae Bourbon, an openly gay female impersonator who rose to prominence in the 1930s and 1940s, released several comedy records that referenced homosexuality. Onstage he performed risqué material, singing songs such as “Mr. Wong Has Got the Biggest Tong in China” and getting arrested several times on charges of obscenity and “staging a lewd performance.”</p>
          <p>In the 1950s, Milton Berle frequently appeared in drag on his mainstream television show. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon’s cross-dressing was also a central plot device in the 1959 movie Some Like It Hot, directed by Billy Wilder. United Artists released the film without a Motion Picture Production Code seal of approval, and its enormous success dealt a deathblow to the Hays Code.</p>
          <p>A 1994 episode of the TV show Roseanne featured the first same-sex kiss in sitcom history. When ABC finally agreed to broadcast the episode, it placed a parental advisory at the start. Three years later, stand-up Ellen DeGeneres had her character come out as gay on the sitcom Ellen. Televangelist Jerry Falwell called her “Ellen DeGenerate,” and the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, refused to air the show. Nonetheless, the episode was watched by 42 million viewers.</p>
          <h2>Don’t Touch That Dial </h2>
          <p>To rule the local airwaves, a radio station usually had to win the morning drive-time slot. This meant stations and their top DJs, the shock jocks, were willing to do almost anything—prank phone calls, sex workers in the studio, outrageous stunts of all sorts. One DJ had a sidekick get a haircut on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, tying up rush-hour traffic for hours. Another castrated and then killed a wild boar in the studio parking lot. Two more promoted a contest for listeners to have sex in a public spot while a third person reported from the scene. </p>
          <p>Petey Greene, a Black DJ working in Washington, D.C., from 1966 to 1984, is most often cited as the first shock jock. One of Greene’s acolytes was a gangly young broadcaster named Howard Stern, who was smart, acid tongued, and seemingly without boundaries. Following the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, Stern wondered on-air why the shooters hadn’t tried to have sex with “the really good-looking girls” who were fleeing in panic. The Howard Stern Show was syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005 and, at its peak, aired in 60 markets in the United States and Canada. </p>
          <p>Oddly, perhaps, television helped end the heyday of the radio shock jock. After Janet Jackson’s much discussed nip slip at the 2004 Super Bowl, Congress passed the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increased fines for both TV and radio broadcasters nearly twentyfold. This effectively discouraged radio stations from going after the PR bump brought by provocative stunts and salty language. </p>
          <h2>Too Soon</h2>
          <p>In the wake of tragic events, modern comedians have grappled with a version of the question “When is it OK to start asking, ‘Besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how’d you like the play?’ ” When are comics using laughter to help a wound heal, and when are they merely picking at a fresh scab? Debate still roils about whether the Holocaust, decades later, is now fair game for comics. (Some, including Joan Rivers and Sarah Silverman, have said emphatically that the time has arrived.)</p>
          <p>Eighteen days after terrorists flew planes into the Pentagon and the twin towers of the World Trade Center, comic Gilbert Gottfried told the audience at a Friars Club roast that he was flying to California after the event. “I can’t get a direct flight,” he riffed. “They said I have to stop at the Empire State Building first.” The audience jeered Gottfried and one member shouted, “Too soon!” The rebuke became a catchphrase for joking about a tragedy while the wound is still fresh. </p>
          <p>“The thing about a joke about the Holocaust, the AIDS crisis, 9/11,” says comedian Judy Gold, “it’s all about the funny. “It’s got to be funny. You can’t tell a crappy joke about the biggest tragedy in the world. You can’t do it.”</p>
          <h2>Oh, What a Tangled Web </h2>
          <p>The internet has been a boon for comedy, allowing performers and viewers to share everything from cat memes to presidential satire. With social media, cell phones, and viral videos, however, every set a comedian does—no matter how small the original venue—has the potential to become a global performance. And a stand-up’s single misstep can ignite a massive firestorm. </p>
          <p>In a culture of microaggressions and speech codes, comedians have faced shaming on social media and have even lost jobs when they’ve crossed the wrong lines. No longer the exclusive province of the government, organized religion, and corporate America, censorship is now crowd-sourced. Audience members, much like the egg-tossing patrons at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, can quickly turn against an errant comedian. </p>
          <p>Will these heightened sensibilities kill comedy? Not likely. The best comedians will continue to plumb the darkness, exposing hypocrisy and hard truths. “Comics shed light,” says comedian Scott Capurro. “We’re as necessary as a lightbulb, yet harder to replace.”</p>
          <h2>Sex: No Longer a Pregnant Pause</h2>
          <p>The Hays Code, which governed the tone and content of American movies for decades, had far more to say about sex than any other topic. It banned nudity, suggestive dancing, prostitution, and lustful kissing. For more than 20 years, married couples on-screen slept in separate beds. Men were required to keep their feet planted during screen kisses, which were not to last more than three seconds. This straitlaced approach also extended to radio, where censors cautioned comedians to avoid using phrases such as “pregnant pause.”</p>
          <p>When I Love Lucy star Lucille Ball became pregnant during the early days of television, the topic was written into the show and rolled out in an episode called “Lucy Is Enceinte.” The word pregnant was never used. In 1967, stand-up comic Joan Rivers made three appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show late in her pregnancy but was forbidden to talk about her condition.</p>
          <p>Fifty years later, a visibly pregnant Ali Wong joked about anal sex, among other topics, in her Netflix comedy special. While a sympathetic take on, say, rape or child molestation is still a ticket for trouble, comedians no longer need to tiptoe into the bedroom. These days they can swing from the chandeliers—and then post the video. </p>
          <h2>The Other Black Humor</h2>
          <p>Racism was fundamental to early American comedy. For much of the 19th century, minstrel shows dominated entertainment in the United States, with white performers wearing blackface and mocking people of African descent through music, dance, and demeaning comic sketches. Blackface proved so popular that many Black comedians of the vaudeville period also donned the distinctive makeup.</p>
          <p>Well into the 20th century, mainstream comedy was largely the domain of white comics. After World War II, as the country moved haltingly toward integration, comedy slowly added performers of color to the national laugh track. Even so, Black comedians found themselves under a constraint not imposed on their white counterparts: They weren’t allowed to target members of the audience. Comedian Slappy White was fired, albeit briefly, for violating this unwritten rule in Las Vegas during the 1950s. </p>
          <p>By the 1970s, that taboo was in shreds. More and more Black comedians were performing routines about race that were both brutally frank and painfully funny. Richard Pryor grabbed the forbidden n-word and, through relentless repetition, made it his trademark. In the mid-1970s he won three straight Grammy Awards for comedy records with provocative titles like That Nigger’s Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger. </p>
          <p>Latino comedians such as George Lopez and Asian American stand-ups including Margaret Cho have also succeeded in turning racism on its head. Cho, who has received multiple Grammy nominations for her comedy, was criticized in 2015 for an impersonation of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un at the Golden Globe Awards. “I’m not playing the race card,” she tweeted afterward. “I’m playing the rice card.”</p>
          <h2>I Swear It’s Funny</h2>
          <p>Vaudeville’s Keith-Albee circuit and Hollywood’s Hays Code had lists of banned words, but neither included the most obscene terms, which were presumably considered too vile to be written down. In 1949, comedian Lenny Ross was arrested in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for being “smutty.” He told the presiding judge, “I resort to smut only because patrons demand it.” </p>
          <p>Comedian Lenny Bruce changed the language of stand-up forever—and was hounded for his transgressions by vice squads and morality police in every city where he played. In 1966, Bruce listed the nine words for which he had been arrested: ass, balls, cocksucker, cunt, fuck, motherfucker, piss, shit, and tits. (He overlooked schmuck, a Yiddish word for penis that had led to his arrest in West Hollywood.) </p>
          <p>A few years later, George Carlin dropped ass and balls from Bruce’s list and developed a bit called “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.” The routine got Carlin arrested in Milwaukee in 1972 and later became the basis for a Supreme Court case that upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate indecency. </p>
          <h2>Religion: The Sacred Cow</h2>
          <p>Despite years of satirizing society’s biggest institutions—the government, the military, big business, academia—comedians in the first half of the 20th century still trod lightly around organized religion. The New Wave comics of the late 1950s, particularly Lenny Bruce, began throwing off such restraints. </p>
          <p>When Monty Python released the 1979 film Life of Brian, a mild biblical satire, Christian and Jewish groups alike took offense. Protests led to screenings being cancelled in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Charlotte, North Carolina. In the United Kingdom, numerous towns—including at least one with no cinema—banned the movie, as did Ireland and Norway. (In Sweden, Life of Brian was touted as “So funny, it was banned in Norway.”)</p>
          <p>Religion is still considered a touchy subject, and comics ranging from Bill Hicks to Kathy Griffin have had bits on Jesus and Christianity excised from shows. But no one, with the possible exception of George Carlin, has gone after religion as relentlessly as South Park. The animated series has poked fun at Jesus, Catholics, Buddhists, Scientologists, and Mormons.</p>
          <p>In 2006, Comedy Central censored part of a South Park episode that included images of the prophet Muhammad. The decision may have been providential: Nine years later, the French weekly Charlie Hebdo was attacked by terrorists who killed a dozen people, including a number of prominent cartoonists, for satirizing Islam and publishing cartoon images of Muhammad.</p>
          <h2>Cable Comedy: That’s Some Good Shit</h2>
          <p>The 1970s saw the rise of the first national pay-television cable networks, which in turn created an enormous need for new content. For its first comedy special in late 1975, Home Box Office enticed Second City veteran Robert Klein with the come-on “And you can say anything you want.” Two years later, a George Carlin special put that promise to the test, warning viewers that the show included “language you hear every day on the street, though rarely on TV.”</p>
          <p>In 1983, when he was 22 and already a huge star, Eddie Murphy recorded a concert film called Delirious for HBO. The comedian’s send-ups of James Brown, Elvis, and Michael Jackson became legend, as did his profanity. Murphy says “fuck” 231 times and “shit” 186 times during the course of the 70-minute film.</p>
          <p>Other cable comics would perform routines that were lewder and lewder, leading Murphy to later tell Rolling Stone, “I’m feeling like a fucking old guy watching Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.”</p>

          <p>Widely regarded as "The Mother of the Sexual Revolution," Rusty Warren developed a unique brand of raw and empowered comedy that involved speaking out for sexual liberation and gender equality. Although here "party records" sold more than 5,000,000 copies and garnered seven Gold Records, Rusty Warren's work was denied radio airplay and she was banned from appearing on mainstream television at the height of her fame.</p>

          <p>In describing her stage persona, Rusty Warren explained: "She couldn't be vulnerable to the people in the audience who would misunderstand it as feminine stupidity. Rusty wasn't stupid. Rusty was sharp. Rusty had a big mouth. Rusty said to the men what the wives wanted to say...but couldn't."</p>

          <p>In 1960, Rusty Warren's most influential album <u>Knockers Up!</u> fueled the fires of the Women's Liberation Movement and became an immediate bestseller, with over one million registered members fo Jubilee Records' "Knockers Up Club." In The album, Rusty explained: "I have said that man was born to thrust upon us the biggest and best they have. I feel that it is our turn now to rise and unite and thrust back at them, with the biggest and best we have. [...] Throw your shoulders back, get your knockers up and put a big smile on your face. Knockers up, everybody!"</p>
