        <h1>Dan Aykroyd’s Motorcycle</h1>

        <p class="ad"> A 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle is elevated on a black platform.The panels behind the motorcycle read:</p>

        <h2>Text written by Dan Aykroyd</h2>

        <p>This 1971 Harley Davidson Police Special motorcycle was ridden by me as my principal method of commuting from Ontario, Canada to Manhattan and back during the four years I worked on <u>Saturday Night Live</u>, from 1975-1979.</p>
        <p>The bike was purchased originally by the Ontario Provincial Police where it was used as a component of their Golden Helmets twelve member precision drill riding team. While performing a pyramid display in Europe (where all the riders climb on the back of two teammates riding two motorcycles with one member standing atop the shoulders of the highest man) there was an accident, the pyramid collapsed, and a motor officer was killed.</p>
        <p>Twelve man pyramid motorcycle riding is dangerous.</p>
        <p>My FLH-P, 1200cc, Electra-Glide with solo seat was NOT the bike involved in the fatality, but it was part of the display formation.</p>
        <p>As for the $2,100 I paid to the wholesale broker who bought the bikes at auction and shipped them back from Germany (I picked the lead bike with the turn signals), my money proved to be well spent. The Police Special certified speedometer is worth more to collectors now than the entire motorcycle itself.  (Although the bike’s enshrinement here may add some value.)</p>
        <p>The clock reflects the miles from my commutes in all seasons.</p>
        <p>In September of 1975, on the first ride to my new job at SNL, halfway down southbound I-81 a station wagon with a large family of children slowed down beside me.</p>
        <p>Everyone began waving and smiling at me. Now this is prior to my appearance on TV in the United States, so I wasn’t known. I thought isn’t this a nice welcome to the United States! Then a few other cars and their passengers pulled up beside me and did the same thing. People smiling, waving, and a few pointing and laughing. What are they looking at? So glancing around to myself, the engine, and my cargo, I looked behind my seat to see that the entire rear end of the motorcycle was on FIRE.</p>
        <p>One of my green army surplus canvas saddlebags had been ignited by the exhaust pipe and the contents of the bag (scripts etc.) were now fully aflame. I was sure that an explosion would be next.</p>
        <p>After pulling over quickly to rip the bag away and beat the flame out, a pair of compassionate outlaw bikers pulled over in their van and offered me assistance plus a cold Genesee.</p>
        <p>Getting my kit straight, the trip resumed and at around eleven pm I entered the far right inbound lane of the George Washington Bridge. Halfway across the span all my electrics CUT OUT and the machine went dead. There is no break down lane on the bridge. The problem had happened before. In the 1970s, Harley partnered with the American Machine Foundry Corporation (a manufacturer of bowling alleys) to supply components for motorcycles.</p>
        <p>Harley-AMF bikes were notorious for electrical glitches. But here was not the optimum location for intricate wiring adjustments with all sizes of vehicles swerving and blaring horns in order to avoid hitting my darkened machine and me. In this setting I was compelled to take out my tools, remove the front headlight cowling and secure the wiring.</p>
        <p>Having to do these repairs on the most hazardous traffic spot on earth was a nightmare.</p>
        <p>After about eight tension-filled minutes I got the ‘Electra-Glide’ restarted and gunned it off the bridge into Harlem. People laughed and pointed at me there too as my ride took me in the wrong directions down many one way streets in my desperate search for the lights of Broadway.</p>
        <p>This first ride concluded with my arrival in Greenwich Village near 376 Bleecker Street where John Belushi and his girlfriend Judy lived. John had instructed me to call from a payphone. Seeing a bar with multiple Harleys lined up outside I stopped there and backed in.</p>
        <p>Inside the bar there were other riders. They were similarly attired as myself – black jeans, black denim jackets, black western shirts, leather jackets, Herman boots, and multi-colored handkerchiefs hanging from the right and left pockets of the men’s jeans – yellow, green, light blue or red like mine. You know, for oil checks.</p>
        <p>My arrival was virtually unnoticed. I ordered a beer, and reaching John on the telephone, he quickly informed me that I was in the local hardcore gay biker nightclub. I hung up, finished my beer, and exchanged some Harley talk with a couple of the guys on the sidewalk outside before heading to John’s. Riders are riders everywhere.</p>
        <p>For the first two years of the show I would park the machine in the Associated Press courier slots across from Rock Center. These are long gone. When I wasn’t using it in the city, it sat UNLOCKED outside my high-rise apartment at 80 North Moore Street. Once Tom Davis and I left for a month long tour of South America. Upon returning the bike was still there untouched except for the residue of repeated sprayings on my front rim from dogs.</p>
        <p>In its last New York years this Harley lived on the fourth floor of my loft at 35 Bond Street. It just fit by inches into the freight elevator and sat during the winters in the living room through many great parties.</p>
        <p>I am very pleased that the ride from my SNL years has found such a prestigious and caring home.</p>
        <p>Gift of Dan Aykroyd</p>

        <p class="ad"> At the entrance to the hallway, there is a large arrow with blinking lights and the word comedy pointing down the hallway. Moving down the hallaway to your right an audience in a dark and small comedy club is staring back at you. Around them are quotes from various comedians reading: </p>

        <h1>George Carlin’s Stuff</h1>

        <p>“I review a file and I get excited: ‘This shit’s going to be GOOD! Can’t wait till they hear THIS!’”</p>

        <p>—George Carlin</p>

        <p>How did a comic genius like George Carlin craft his jokes? What insights and observations inspired his most famous routines? Fortunately for comedy fans, the answers lie within the staggering amount of personal material that the comedian assembled over the course of his 50-year career.</p>

        <p>Carlin meticulously recorded his experiences and reflected on his art and life. He logged notes in diary-like appointment books, diligently filed away ticket stubs and newspaper reviews, and saved annotated drafts of almost every comedy set he performed. For decades, he jotted down pithy observations on hotel stationery and scraps of paper, all of which were thoughtfully catalogued in alphabetized Ziploc bags. Today, this collection beautifully illustrates the constant and careful observation, accumulation, and organization of ideas that formed the bedrock of Carlin’s comedic process.</p>

        <p>Carlin left behind more than 50 boxes of paper material, photographs, and other memorabilia, as well as over 1,000 hours of rare audiovisual footage. Packed into steamer trunks, this extraordinary material came to light shortly after Carlin’s passing in 2008, when five storage units filled with the comedian’s “stuff” were inherited by his daughter, Kelly.</p>

        <p>The George Carlin Collection, acquired by the National Comedy Center in 2016, offers a unique and extraordinarily intimate window into the mind of one of comedy’s most prolific and influential figures. This exclusive glimpse into the collection has been designed to represent, as closely as possible, Carlin’s own extensive efforts to document his life and work.</p>

        <h1>Late Night</h1>

        <p>Late-night talk shows have produced some of comedy’s biggest names, from Carson and Leno to Letterman and Conan. Hundreds of comedians got their big break from an after-hours appearance, and many late-night interviews—whether serious, funny, or just plain bizarre—became front-page news.</p>

        <p>As end-of-day entertainment, late night has provided a reliable mix of crowd-pleasing humor and must-see commentary. With jokes about topics like Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandal, as well as interviews with public figures from JFK to Donald Trump, late night has captured the very history of modern America.</p>

        <h2>Late Night Kicks Off</h2>

        <p>The idea of airing a television show after 11 p.m. was initially rejected as lunacy. Network executives simply did not think anyone would watch TV that late. Broadway Open House was the first program to test the time slot, premiering live on May 29, 1950, from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. To find a studio audience at such an odd hour, NBC wrangled people from the nearby Greyhound bus station.</p>

        <p>Airing five nights a week, Broadway Open House created a demanding workload, and NBC soon hired two comedians, Jerry Lester and Morey Amsterdam, to host on alternate nights. Lester opened each episode by telling jokes, interacting with the studio audience, and bantering with bandleader Milton Delugg. Although the program favored comedy sketches and musical guests over interviews, it established late night’s general template.</p>

        <h2>Tonight Finds Its Focus</h2>

        <p>In June 1953, NBC revamped its programming with a new late-night show hosted by former radio comedian Steve Allen. The program debuted as The Knickerbocker Beer Show and was renamed Tonight! in 1954. Only East Coast audiences saw these early episodes, as the technology for broadcasting coast-to-coast did not yet exist.</p>

        <p>During his tenure, Steve Allen made spontaneity a late-night hallmark, confidently wandering into the audience and posing the kind of “Where you folks from?” questions now associated with comedy clubs. In most cases, these impromptu moments earned Allen huge laughs.</p>

        <p>In 1957, NBC unveiled Tonight Starring Jack Paar. Also a former radio comedian, Paar introduced several classic late-night features: a long opening monologue, a sidekick co-host, and a focus on interviews. He was constantly in the news for picking fights with the press, feuding with guests, and criticizing NBC. During an opening monologue in 1960 he quit the program and walked off the show, leaving sidekick Hugh Downs scrambling to cover the remaining airtime. Although Paar soon returned, he left Tonight permanently in 1962, worn down by the demands of hosting a 105-minute program every weeknight.</p>

        <h2>Reign of the King</h2>

        <p>Johnny Carson was still under contract to ABC when he was hired to replace Jack Paar. While waiting for Carson, NBC brought on temporary hosts such as Jerry Lewis, Arlene Francis, Groucho Marx, and a young Merv Griffin. The network was so impressed by Griffin’s natural ease with guests that it hired him as a backup host “in case Johnny didn’t work out.”</p>

        <p>With Carson’s ABC contract finally completed, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson—and its daytime counterpart, The Merv Griffin Show—premiered on October 1, 1962, broadcasting from NBC’s Studio 6B. It took Carson a full year to find his footing and win over hostile critics, but he eventually developed into a smooth, reliable wit, known for his impish charm and ability to think on his feet.</p>

        <p>The Tonight Show hit full stride in the 1970s, establishing its iconic imagery—plaid suits, tricolor backdrop curtain, phantom golf swings—and familiar grace notes: cracks about jokes falling flat, good-natured ribbing about Ed McMahon’s drinking, a constant haze of cigarette smoke. Providing a national platform for countless politicians, celebrities, and comics, Carson was truly “the King of Late Night.”</p>

        <h2>The Network Battles Begin</h2>

        <p>NBC dominated late night for over a decade, with the other networks simply airing old movies or test patterns in the time slot. In 1964, ABC unveiled Tonight’s first actual competitor: The Les Crane Show, starring the provocative former radio host. Crane was soon fired, but when ABC relaunched the program as Nightlife in 1965, he returned with comedian Nipsey Russell—network television’s first Black co-host—at his side.</p>

        <p>A new syndicated version of The Merv Griffin Show, produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting, aired in May 1965 and was scheduled against Carson in several markets. Griffin gave comedians license to do whatever they liked short of cursing, and it’s no coincidence that George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Lily Tomlin all emerged as bold new voices shortly after their guest appearances on the show.</p>

        <p>In 1967, ABC hired the low-key member of Frank Sinatra’s Rat Pack to host The Joey Bishop Show. When Bishop went to Vietnam to entertain the troops, guest hosts included comedians Don Rickles and Totie Fields. The show’s announcer was a young Regis Philbin.</p>

        <p>August 1969 marked the start of the “late-night wars,” with all three networks airing competing talk shows: Carson on NBC, Bishop on ABC, and yet another version of The Merv Griffin Show on CBS. In order to secure Griffin, CBS had—amazingly—met his demand to receive double Carson’s salary.</p>

        <h2>Early Iconoclasts</h2>

        <p>Airing from 1969 to 1973, The Dick Cavett Show coincided with some of the nation’s most tumultuous moments. While Carson was deliberately apolitical, Cavett jumped into the fray, booking antiwar activists, hippie spokespeople, and controversial figures from both the right and left. As a result, the program remains one of the most important social documents in television history. In late 1973, ABC relegated the show to a once-a-month broadcast that ended in 1975. Many concluded that the Nixon administration was behind the demotion.</p>

        <p>In January 1973, ABC tried out George Carlin as a potential replacement for Cavett. Only the pilot of The George Carlin Show ever aired: Carlin wore his trademark tie-dyed T-shirt and interviewed Shelley Winters, among other guests. The episode tested poorly and ABC dropped the project.</p>

        <h2>Guest Hosts Go Big</h2>

        <p>During the 1970s, The Tonight Show was the most profitable program on television, and Carson wielded incredible power. He demanded higher pay and took longer vacations, opening the door to a series of guest hosts including David Brenner, Betty White, Bob Newhart, David Steinberg, and McLean Stevenson. By the 1980s, the most frequent guest hosts were Garry Shandling, Joan Rivers, and Jay Leno.</p>

        <p>David Letterman was another standby host on The Tonight Show, filling in for Carson nearly 50 times between 1978 and 1981. Impressed with his natural abilities, NBC hired Letterman for a morning talk show beginning in 1980. The early time slot proved inappropriate for his sarcastic wit and The David Letterman Show was soon canceled, but the comedian earned two Emmys for it and developed signature segments such as “Stupid Pet Tricks.”</p>

        <p>Late Night with David Letterman premiered in February 1982 and became one of the most influential late-night programs of all time, with a rebellious underground vibe and an art-school sensibility. Stand-up comedians Jonathan Katz, Norm Macdonald, Adam Sandler, and Jon Stewart all got major breaks on the program, which also introduced cult favorites Harvey Pekar, Pee-wee Herman, and Larry “Bud” Melman to a national audience.</p>

        <h2>The Late Show: Rivers to Hall</h2>

        <p>The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers debuted on the brand-new Fox television network in October 1986, making Rivers the first woman to helm a network late-night talk show. Although Rivers interviewed Lucille Ball and introduced Chris Rock, the show is perhaps best remembered for the rift it caused between Rivers and Carson. With Fox unavailable in many markets, the program was not widely seen and was canceled in 1987.</p>

        <p>Hired to host the remaining Late Show episodes, Arsenio Hall stunned executives with a massive ratings spike and was offered his own program in 1989. The Arsenio Hall Show was a cultural phenomenon, best remembered for its time capsule trademarks—Hall’s high-top fade, the “Dog Pound” section of the studio audience, and the whooping sound the crowd made as Hall circled his fist in the air. In perhaps the show’s most famous moment, Bill Clinton played the saxophone while campaigning for the presidency.</p>

        <h2>Leno vs. Letterman</h2>

        <p>After 30 years on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson retired in May 1992, causing seismic shifts in the late-night landscape and kicking off an intense rivalry between Jay Leno and David Letterman. Many assumed that Letterman, as Carson’s protégé, would ascend to the Tonight Show throne. Instead, the crown was passed to Leno, Carson’s frequent guest host. Both the public and the press went wild for behind-the-scenes gossip about the feud.</p>

        <p>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno debuted in May 1992. Leno’s lengthy opening monologue, notable for the sheer volume of jokes, was modeled on Bob Hope’s television specials. Recurring segments included “Headlines,” which highlighted moronic newspaper stories from around the country, and “Jaywalking,” in which Leno asked people on the street simple questions and received painfully wrong answers—to great comedic effect.</p>

        <p>In 1993, Letterman shifted networks and time slots to become Leno’s direct competition—not to mention the highest-paid host in late-night history. Airing at 11:30 p.m. on CBS, The Late Show with David Letterman made stars out of local business owners like Rupert Jee of the Hello Deli and featured countless iconic moments in its 22-year run: Drew Barrymore dancing on the desk, Letterman taking over a Taco Bell, a difficult interview with Joaquin Phoenix, and a somber address after 9/11.</p>

        <p>Leno trailed Letterman in the ratings until July 1995, when actor Hugh Grant, just days after being arrested with a prostitute, addressed the scandal on The Tonight Show. Leno’s memorable first question: “What the hell were you thinking?” From that episode until his retirement in 2014, Jay Leno remained at the top of late-night ratings.</p>

        <h2>The Midnight Hour: Conan and Kimmel</h2>

        <p>Late Night with Conan O’Brien first aired in September 1993, filling Letterman’s vacant 12:30 a.m. slot at NBC. It was, according to head writer Robert Smigel, “a sketch comedy program disguised as a talk show.” Much of the humor was simply too weird and awkward for veteran critics, who called for the program’s cancellation. The issue wasn’t lack of comic talent—O’Brien had written for both Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons—but lack of on-camera experience.</p>

        <p>Despite the rocky start, O’Brien’s offbeat style spoke to the under-30 set, and recurring characters such as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and Andy Richter’s Little Sister—played by Amy Poehler—gave the show a unique stamp. In the end, Late Night with Conan O’Brien lasted for 16 years, winning dedicated fans and the respect of the comedy community itself.</p>

        <p>After an eight-month stint hosting The Tonight Show, O’Brien moved to TBS and launched Conan in 2010. The new program was distinguished by extended specials that wittily explored serious issues in places like Armenia, Cuba, and Mexico.</p>

        <p>In 2003, ABC tapped former radio host and Comedy Central regular Jimmy Kimmel for the midnight slot. For years, Jimmy Kimmel Live! struggled to find its footing, but eventually hit its stride with segments such as “This Week in Unnecessary Censorship” and “Mean Tweets,” as well as a running gag about Kimmel’s mock feud with actor Matt Damon. In 2012, Kimmel moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot to compete directly—and successfully—against Leno and Letterman. The show’s newsworthy moments included an appearance by beleaguered Toronto mayor Rob Ford; comedian Andy Dick’s ejection from the program; and Kimmel’s heartfelt pleas for socialized health care.</p>

        <h2>Expanding the Lineup</h2>

        <p>Chelsea Lately premiered in 2007 on the E! channel and became cable TV’s first runaway success in the late-night slot. Along with conducting guest interviews, host Chelsea Handler led a rotating panel of comedians in ridiculing celebrities—a perfect match for E!’s gossipy style. Handler also gave many Los Angeles–based comedians their television debuts, making a concerted effort to showcase little-known female comics such as Natasha Leggero and Whitney Cummings.</p>

        <p>In 2009, two shows brought a small amount of diversity to the late-night lineup. The Wanda Sykes Show lasted only four months on Fox, but was the first late-night talk show hosted by an openly gay woman. On TBS, Mexican American comedian George Lopez became the first Latino to host his own program on English-language television. Lopez Tonight ran for nearly two years.</p>

        <h2>The Late Late Shift</h2>

        <p>The Late Late Show on CBS premiered in January 1995. It aired immediately after Letterman and was produced by his company, Worldwide Pants. Over the next decade, the program went through multiple formats and hosts, from legendary broadcaster Tom Snyder to frat-boy sportscaster Craig Kilborn.</p>

        <p>The program finally found its stride in 2005 with comedian Craig Ferguson at the helm. Ferguson affected a devil-may-care style, often ripping up his interview notes to signal that freewheeling entertainment took priority over polished sound bites. In his opening monologues, he often discussed personal experiences rather than delivering topical jokes—a style that harkened back to Jack Paar.</p>

        <p>James Corden replaced Ferguson in 2015, bringing a brisk pace and an emphasis on music to The Late Late Show. “Carpool Karaoke” became its most famous feature, with Corden driving around famous pop stars like Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Rod Stewart while they sang along to their greatest hits. The short segments lent themselves perfectly to YouTube, and many fans discovered Corden online rather than on television.</p>

        <h2>Politics Takes Center Stage</h2>

        <p>Thanks to the major influence of Jon Stewart and The Daily Show, late night shifted its focus from straightforward interviews to comedic political commentary. Although the satirical programs helmed by former Daily Show correspondents Samantha Bee and John Oliver couldn’t be defined as talk shows, they were among the most important programs in the modern late-night landscape.</p>

        <p>Late Night with Seth Meyers, which debuted in 2014, brought this new political angle to the late-night talk show. Rather than opening with a standing monologue, Meyers ultimately chose to sit behind a desk, cracking wise about current events as news graphics appeared on-screen. It became a trademark element, combining Meyers’s experience anchoring SNL’s “Weekend Update” with his penchant for fearless political commentary. The segment “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell” also flouted late-night conventions, with two of the show’s female writers—one Black and one gay—flanking Meyers as they spouted punch lines that would be in poor taste if delivered by a straight white man.</p>

        <p>In 2015, Stephen Colbert transitioned from parody to politics by leaving The Colbert Report on Comedy Central to host The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS. The show struggled for a full year as viewers adjusted to Colbert’s new persona as an actual talk-show host, and then the program found its groove during the 2016 presidential campaign. An opening monologue packed with political jokes, relentless mockery of the White House, and interviews with reporters, policy wonks, and politicians distinguished the program.</p>

        <p>One exception to the political trend was Jimmy Fallon, known for delivering lighthearted fare to viewers of all political persuasions. Fallon became host of Late Night in 2009, and despite critics and naysayers, his energy and charm brought in a new, younger audience. Five years later, Fallon inherited The Tonight Show, altering the format to include competitions like “Password” and “Lip Sync Battle.” The program broadcast from Studio 6B in 30 Rockefeller Center, the same studio where Johnny Carson made his Tonight Show debut back in 1962.</p>

        <p>Today, the era of late-night talk shows on network television may be coming to a close, as people watch less traditional television or abandon their TV sets entirely. Netflix programming like Handler’s Chelsea and Letterman’s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction brought late night into the streaming age and made time of day irrelevant for viewers. The future of the format—like a great talk-show guest—is impossible to predict. For now, late night remains a staple of the American experience, providing comedy and controversy well past our bedtimes.</p>

        <h1>Jokes with a View</h1>

        <h1>Great One-Liners</h1>
        <p>“Brevity is the soul of wit,” wrote Shakespeare in <u>Hamlet</u>. Case in point: the short-but-sweet jokes known as one-liners. Most are no longer than a sentence, but they can still pack a powerful comedic punch. </p>
        <p>Consisting of just two elements—a setup and a punchline—one-liners are deceptively simple. In fact, comedians carefully craft each word of these zingers to engage, tease, surprise, and delight their audience—and above all, leave them laughing.</p>

        Andy Kaufman’s Elvis Jacket

        Courtesy of Andy Kaufman Memorial Trust

        Andy Kaufman was a renegade who diverged from mainstream comedy. Beyond his memorable performances on Taxi and Saturday Night Live, Kaufman fully embodied oddball characters like Foreign Man, an uncomfortable, nervous impressionist who could suddenly transform into a spot-on Elvis Presley. Kaufman also seized headlines with outrageous public performances. Among other students, Kaufman challenged women to wrestling matches, and stepped into the ring with professional wrestler Jerry “ The King” Lawler.

        Letter to Elvis Presley, 1969: Andy Kaufman idolized Elvis Presley and wrote to him while attending Graham Junior College in Boston. In 1929, he traveled (uninvited) to Las Vegas to introduce himself to Elvis.

        Notecards with outlines from “Foreign Man” routines, c. 1977

        Door Card from The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, 1977: Kaufman practiced transcendental meditation and attributed his onstage confidence to its effects. He left this note on his dressing room door before a Tonight Show appearance.

              Across decades, Rodney Dangerfield copiously wrote thousands of pages of original jokes. He carried them everywhere he went in the monogrammed bag displayed here. The bag accompanied Dangerfield to countless late night talk show appearances and live performances at venues like Radio City Music Hall and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. On the way to his final heart surgery, Dangerfield threw a pair of slippers in this bag along with a stack joke, two pens, and extra paper.
