          <p class="width50"> The <b>Interactive Wall</b> was a <b>interdisciplinary team project I led</b> designed for students, faculty, and visitors of the Shineman Science Center at SUNY Oswego. The installation gave passersby the opportunity to <b>step away from the present</b> and explore small experiences which tried to transport them to a <b>new mindset</b>. These included <b>creativity, inspiration, excitement, and relaxation</b>. The user interacts with each experience through the use of a <b>Leap Motion Sensor</b>, allowing them to use their <b>hands without direct touch</b>. This <b>novel interaction</b> was a <b>unique design challenge</b> but the experience created was <b>exciting</b> for many first time users.</p>

          <p>The team set out to identify pieces of <b>artwork, music, and quotes</b> that users of this space might find <b>relaxing or engaging</b>. Though <b>highly subjective</b>, the <b>survey</b> create by the HCI graduate students on the team had <b>63 respondence</b> and some <b>patterns emerged</b>. These patterns were used to generate the <b>four experiences</b> for the installation; <b>Blocks (creativity), Fireworks (excitement), Pond (relaxation), Gallery (inspiration)</b>.</p>

          <h2>gestures</h2>
          <p class = "width50" > <b>In-air gesture</b> recognition was a <b>novel and interesting</b> mode of interaction. These gesture based interactions come with <b>unique challenges</b> that the team had to uncover. Using a <b>Leap Motion Sensor</b>, the installation was able to <b>track the users hands and fingers</b> to manipulate and interact with the installation. The team set out to establish a <b>gesture guide</b> looking to create gestures that were <b>quick to learn and consistent</b>. Select gestures were reserved for cross system use.</p>

          <img src="images/wall/selection.svg">
          <img src="images/wall/clutch.svg">
          <p class = "column2">The team had to <b>overcome many challenges</b>, two of the main challenges were dealing with the common problem of <b>false recognition</b> or what some call the <b>live mic problem</b>. In terms of <b>selection</b>, the team decided to use a <b>time-driven</b> approach. When the hand hovered over a "clickable" item a <b>count down</b> would begin <b>before selection was registered</b>. The user would see the hand indicator <b>fill with color</b> and also <b>hear sound feedback</b>. In one of the experiences a <b>clutch</b> was established to help <b>combat the live mic problem</b>. This <b>clutch</b> is a <b>virtual plane</b> that when crossed would start recognition. This has it's own <b>limitations</b>. User's <b>height and distance from the sensor</b> made the <b>location of the plane difficult to establish</b>.</p>
