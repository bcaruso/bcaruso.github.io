          <p class = "callout"> Interactive Wall, a 10 week team project implementing a gesture based interactive installation.</p>
          <p class="width50"> The Interactive Wall was a interdisciplinary team project I led. It was designed for students, faculty, and visitors of the Shineman Science Center at SUNY Oswego. The installation gave passersby the opportunity to step away from the present and explore small experiences which tried to transport them to a new mindset. These included creativity, inspiration, excitement, and relaxation. The user interacts with each experience through the use of a Leap Motion Sensor, allowing them to use their hands without direct touch. This novel interaction was a unique design challenge but the experience created was exciting for many first time users.</p>

          <p>The team set out to identify pieces of artwork, music, and quotes that users of this space might find relaxing or engaging. Though highly subjective, the survey created by the HCI graduate students on the team had 63 respondence and some patterns emerged. These patterns were used to generate the four experiences for the installation; Blocks (creativity), Fireworks (excitement), Pond (relaxation), Gallery (inspiration).</p>

          <h2>gestures</h2>
          <p class = "width50" > In-air gesture recognition was a novel and interesting mode of interaction. These gesture based interactions come with unique challenges that the team had to uncover. Using a Leap Motion Sensor, the installation was able to track the users hands and fingers to manipulate and interact with the installation. The team set out to establish a gesture guide to create gestures that were quick to learn and consistent. Select gestures were reserved for cross system use.</p>

          <img src="images/wall/clutch.svg">
          <p class = "column2">The team had to overcome many challenges, two of the main challenges were dealing with the common problem of false recognition or what some call the live mic problem. In terms of selection, the team decided to use a time-driven approach. When the hand hovered over a "clickable" item a count down would begin before selection was registered. The user would see the hand indicator fill with color and also hear sound feedback. In one of the experiences a clutch was established to help combat the live mic problem. This clutch is a virtual plane that when crossed would start recognition. This has it's own limitations. User's height and distance from the sensor made the location of the plane difficult to establish.</p>
