          <p class = "callout"> Empowering pediatric dialysis patients to build relationships through creativity.</p>
          <p class = "copy">Pediatric hemodialysis patients at Seattle Children’s Hospital must spend three to five hours, three to five times a week at the dialysis unit to compensate for their lost kidney function. When receiving dialysis treatment, patients must remain seated for the whole treatment while being physically connected to a dialysis machine. This environment limits the activities a patient can do and the interactions that can take place between patients while receiving treatment. Buddy Blocks looks to bridge these barriers between patients during treatment to empower patients to build relationships and explore new creative possibilities.</p>

            <p> The ability to physically change the characteristics of the blocks enhances the experience and unlocks creative possibilities.

This allows for quick adoption by the patients and provides an established model for the patient to understand how to interact with the blocks.</p>

Connecting two blocks together transfers content from one block to another, depending on the state of each block. For example, display blocks transfer and scale the image across multiple displays, as long as the displays share the same image.</p>

          <h2>research</h2>
          <p>Prior to discovering the dialysis unit, the team did an in-depth literature review. The team explored how technology is currently incorporated into the patient care process, the difficulties pediatric patients and their families face, and the long term effects hospitalization has on pediatric patients. While exploring Seattle Children's Hospital, through a guided tour, the team identify the hemodialysis unit as a focused and unique area to explore. Further secondary research took place focused on hemodialysis patients and a collection of primary research activities took place to help the team identify challenges in this space and gain a better understanding.</p>

              <h3>more than a treatment</h3>
              <p>It quickly became clear that receiving hemodialysis is a lifestyle that affects not only the patient but also their family. It becomes entangled in multiple aspects of their life. This unveiled numerous opportunities for the team to explore. Such diet, patient education, and entertainment during treatment.</p>

              <h3>beyond distraction</h3>
              <p> We recognized that many of the different forms of entertainment were shallow distractions. Like playing games on their iPad or watching videos on Youtube. When talking with the patients we heard things like ‘You get tired of the iPad, after a while.’ or ‘I get bored sitting here, but its exciting when people come in to play’. We needed to move beyond these kinds of distractions and use the time in the unit toward developing a more enriching experience that involved bringing patients together.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>culture of containment</h3>
              <p>Because of infection control and the nature of the treatment, patients are separated far apart in the room. These barriers restrict interactions between patients and  the activities they can do while on treatment. It was surprising to see that even patients would comment on these constraints.</p>

          <p>Despite all these constraints and challenges, a strong community exists in the unit. Patients, parents, and nurses exchange greetings, give hugs, and play jokes on each other. However, these interactions between patients disappear during treatment. The team saw this as a perfect opportunity for a design intervention.</p>

                    <h3>comic boarding</h3>
                    <p>When evaluating the blocks with patients, we looked for a method that could quickly establish context due to the novelty of the interface. Comic boarding provided both a clear context and a way to incorporate moments for the prototype to be used by the participant to evaluate the prototype.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Comic boarding is commonly used to generate ideas, however, the team saw it as a great tool for evaluation. Comic boarding is a story or comic that has missing moments or panes that are filled in by the participant. The story didn't tell the participant how to interact with the blocks (the purpose of the evaluation), but rather gave a standard use case for the blocks.

                    <p>The culmination of this 6 month endeavor is showcased in both the Design Specification and the Product Video created for Buddy Blocks. Buddy Blocks was an amazing journey that showcases the power of the design process. Working collaboratively with not only fellow designers but also the doctors, nurses, and most importantly the patients and their families at Seattle Children's crafted a unique design that has exciting potential. This design not only responds to the initial challenge but has the potential to expand beyond its intended context. Buddy Blocks breaks down barriers, expands creativity, and brings kids together. </p>
